# Mobile Debug Extension

Use this when an agent needs to inspect or iterate on the mobile app with a
real device, Android emulator, or iOS simulator.

## Platform Backends

- Android uses adb for install, launch, uiautomator taps, screenshots, and
  logcat phase markers.
- iOS simulator support should use `xcrun simctl` for boot/install/launch,
  `simctl io screenshot`, and `simctl spawn <udid> log stream`.
- Physical iOS device logs are not streamed by this extension; use Console.app
  and `vibestudio mobile install --platform ios --device <udid>` for install.

## Canonical Sandboxed Install

From workspace eval, use the extension rather than spawning the CLI or invoking
`adb`:

```ts
const devices = await extensions.invoke("mobile-debug", "listDevices", []);
const install = await extensions.invoke("mobile-debug", "installAndroid", [
  { device: devices[0]?.serial, resetApp: true, launch: true },
]);
const verification = await extensions.invoke("mobile-debug", "verify", [
  { device: devices[0]?.serial },
]);
return { devices, install, verification };
```

`installAndroid` emits the normal scoped user approval. Automated system tests
must satisfy that request through a host-attested case authority policy; they
must not add an extension flag or alternate no-approval method.

`verify` returns bounded status evidence (`installed`, `rendering`,
`screenshotCaptured`, `screenshotBytes`, and `issues`). It deliberately does
not embed the screenshot bytes; call `screenshot` separately only when the
image itself is needed.

After a pairing or provisioning workflow, verify the workspace shell rather
than stopping at process liveness:

```ts
const startedAt = Date.now();
// Run the pairing/provisioning operation here.
const workspace = await extensions.invoke("mobile-debug", "verifyWorkspaceReady", [
  { device: devices[0]?.serial, sinceMs: startedAt, timeoutMs: 180_000 },
]);
```

`verifyWorkspaceReady` waits for both `workspace-panels-initialized` and
`workspace-connected`. It also fails immediately on panel activation/load
errors, including corrupt compressed assets. `panelWebViewLoaded` is reported
separately because an existing panel may remain intentionally held by another
device until the user selects **Take over**. Keep the documented three-minute
deadline for cold source workspaces: their first mobile host build can take
longer than a minute even though subsequent launches are immediate.

## Pairing Smoke Markers

Watch for `[VibestudioMobileSmoke] phase=...` lines:

- `embedded-pairing-start`
- `embedded-pairing-complete`
- `embedded-bootstrap-fetch-start`
- `embedded-bundle-activate-start`
- `embedded-bundle-activate-complete`
- `workspace-panel-webview-loaded`

Missing markers usually mean the failure is in pairing, bundle delivery,
native activation, or panel materialization respectively.

## Debugging A Bad Mobile Panel

- Android: use logcat, screenshots, and WebView debugging in Debug/Internal
  builds.
- iOS: use simulator screenshots/log stream and Safari Web Inspector for
  WKWebView in Debug/Internal builds. CDP automation is not available for
  mobile-held WebViews.
- If the active bundle is suspect, re-pair or call native reset so the shipped
  bootstrap can recover.

## Commands

```bash
node scripts/cli/mobile-smoke.mjs --platform android --avd <name>
node scripts/cli/mobile-smoke.mjs --platform ios --simulator <name>
pnpm smoke:full
```
