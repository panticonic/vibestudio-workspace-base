/**
 * Agentic coverage for the question-shaped provenance surfaces.
 *
 * The unit suites for walks, `prov_*` queries, and search run against the
 * sql.js fallback, so they cannot fail on anything the deployed engine decides:
 * SQLite deployment limits, FTS5 availability, `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN` behavior,
 * or the host↔authority dispatch seam. These cases run a real agent against a
 * real workspace authority, which is the only instrument that observes those.
 *
 * Every case therefore carries one shared liveness assertion beyond its user
 * outcome: a provenance surface may refuse, but it may not be *dead*. A surface
 * that fails closed on every call looks identical to a healthy one from the
 * agent's final answer, and identical to a passing unit suite.
