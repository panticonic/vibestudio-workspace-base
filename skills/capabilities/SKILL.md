# Capabilities and workspace services

Read this skill before adding a host-service effect, a worker or Durable Object API,
an authority request, or a workspace-owned approval flow.

When changing host enforcement, mission closure, static host authority, or the
System Agent boundary, also read
[`references/authority-implementation-checklist.md`](references/authority-implementation-checklist.md).
It names the review inputs and tests that must move together.

## The four things that must stay separate

1. A **method contract** says which authenticated principals may call a method, its
   tier, its receiver requirements, and how its concrete resource is derived.
2. A unit's checked-in **authority manifest** is the maximum authority that exact
   source artifact requests. A request is intent, never permission.
3. A host **grant or fresh approval** authorizes an eligible request. Open methods do
   not need a grant; gated methods intersect requests with grants; critical methods
   require a fresh approval for every exercise.
4. A workspace service's **provided capability** protects a resource the service
   owns. The receiver declares and enforces it before provider code runs; downstream
   host effects such as egress, credential use, protected publication, or external
   browser opens still acquire their own host capabilities independently.

Never turn discovery, a build, generated documentation, a static code census, or an
observed invocation into a grant. Generated authority ledgers are review/audit evidence
only; editing or regenerating one is not capability approval. Workspace code admission
comes from a human decision over the exact sealed version and manifest, not a generated
static host catalog.

`workers.resetStorage` and `workers.restoreStorageBackup` exercise the reviewed
`workers.storage.reset` capability. They accept only one exact Durable Object
source/class/object key, require an audit `intent`, and use the normal critical
approval path. A resolved handle identifies the target but does not authorize
replacement. `workers.listStorageBackups` is read-only discovery. Prefer a
forward schema migration whenever the state is not explicitly disposable.

## Inspecting and changing live decisions

Use the host permission inventory when someone asks what access is active across the
workspace:

```ts
const inventory = await rpc.call("main", "permissions.list", []);
```

`permissions.list` returns the grant inventory directly as a `SavedPermissionGrant[]`;
it is not wrapped in `{ grants: ... }`. Each row has non-empty `id`, `kind`,
`callerLabel`, `scopeLabel`, `why`, `approvedBy`, `duration`, and `revokeEffect`
fields. `kind` is `capability`, `credential-use`, or `browser-site`; optional
resource, provenance, and timestamp fields are also returned when applicable.
Treat the result as an array before inspecting or slicing it, especially when the
inventory is large. This is a read-only inspection; use the explicit approval UI
and host permission APIs for changes.

Do not ask for a decision from inside provider code. Declare the resource in
`vibestudio.authority.provides` and bind the receiving `@rpc` method to its local
capability. The host derives the exact receiver resource, evaluates the canonical
grant store, and presents the normal approval card before entering the method.

For prepared provider state, declare a handle-producing method and return
`prepareOpaqueHandle(selector, presentation)`. The host replaces that preparation
with an unguessable handle. A consuming method declares
`resource: { kind: "opaque-handle", argument: 0 }`; it receives the private selector
only after the host has checked the handle's workspace, capability definition,
provider, logical receiver, and resource type. A handle identifies a resource but
never authorizes it.

## Dynamic workspace capabilities

Workspace-built services are discovered from the exact caller's live semantic
workspace context. They are not limited to a startup scan or a checked-in global
census.

### Agent authoring loop: keep docs outside eval

`docs_search` and `docs_open` are agent tools. They are **not** globals or exports
inside `eval`; `docs`, `docs.search`, and `docs.open` are undefined there. Use this
order after editing a provider:

1. Call the agent tool `workspace_service` with `operation: "upsert"`. It writes
   the `services` row and, when `transport.objectKey` is present, the matching
   `singletonObjects` row as one schema-validated semantic edit. Do not splice
   either YAML list with generic `edit`/`write`; a singleton is launchable
   infrastructure, not a discoverable service by itself. Supply the required
   `presentation` and `notability` values from the tool schema so authority
   prompts can describe and prioritize the service consistently; a `sharing`
   domain also requires `substanceKind`.
2. Call the agent tool `docs_search` for the new service name or protocol. If the
   row is absent, stop: the declaration is missing or invalid in the current
   context. Re-read the relevant YAML and repair it. Do not start eval and do not
   guess a route.
3. Call the agent tool `docs_open` for the service and exact method. Only after it
   reports the expected live provider version and method should you start eval.
4. Inside eval, use only the documented runtime exports:

```ts
import { workers, rpc } from "@workspace/runtime";
const service = await workers.resolveService("example.protocol.v1");
if (service.kind !== "durable-object") throw new Error("Expected a Durable Object service");
return rpc.call(service.targetId, "methodName", []);
```

Import only runtime values that the eval actually uses. TypeScript's `type`
keyword is a modifier for a real imported type name, not an export named
`type`; never write `import { workers, type } from "@workspace/runtime"`.

There is no polling delay in this sequence. A docs result is the read-after-edit
proof that the current semantic context can build and describe the declaration;
absence is a concrete authoring diagnostic, not eventual success to wait for.

- Declare a service with `workspace_service`, supplying a stable protocol,
  source, user-facing title/action/description, reviewed `notability`,
  principals, and transport.
- Use the agent tools `docs_search` / `docs_open` to inspect the live
  caller-visible contract before starting an eval. These are tool names, not
  `@workspace/runtime` exports. Inside eval, consume the result through the
  documented `workers.*` and `rpc.*` runtime APIs. Service and API docs are
  generated from the same exact declaration set used for resolution. Never
  reference `docs` from eval code.
- To enumerate services before you know a name or protocol, call
  `docs_search({ query: "", surface: "workspace" })`. Open one of the returned
  IDs; do not search source files or another unit's manifest to reconstruct the
  live service registry.
- `workers.listServices()` is the lightweight runtime enumeration. Each
  workspace-owned row carries its `docsId`; open that id with `docs_open` before
  choosing a receiver method. This is the same live catalog, not a second census.
- Tool calls use the strict shapes `docs_search({ query: "...", surface?, limit? })`
  and `docs_open({ id: "workspace:<service>[.<method>]" })`. Do not pass filesystem
  `path` fields or copy search fields into `docs_open`.
- Resolve by protocol with `workers.resolveService(protocol, objectKey?)` or
  `workers.resolveDurableObject(source, className, objectKey)`, then call the returned
  target through `rpc.call` or a typed client.
- Resolution, direct-RPC authority, and provider identity are bound to the same caller
  context and exact provider effective version. A declaration visible in another
  context does not authorize or resolve in this one.

Do not add workspace service names to a generated host catalog. Static reviewed
censuses are appropriate for static host capabilities; workspace-built units
must remain live, context-relative declarations.

The provider method roster and source signatures in live docs are derived during the
exact context build and sealed with that build's effective version. This metadata is
documentation only: it neither requests nor grants authority, and the receiver's live
`@rpc` declaration independently remains default-deny. A missing method contract is a
provider documentation defect to fix, not a reason to guess from source.

An installed unit that knows a service contract requests the exact
`workspace-service:<name>` capability in its reviewed manifest. Admitted agent eval is
different: the live declaration chooses the exact service capability and provider EV,
then the ordinary session grant or acquisition, mission closure, context-integrity
latch, and receiver policy intersect at the call. Evaluated code has no manifest
ceiling and receives no authority from the harness package. Never replace live
selection with a generated list of today's service names.

The shortest authoring loop is:

1. Add the worker/DO method and its `@rpc` receiver contract.
2. Add the context-local singleton/service declaration to `meta/vibestudio.yml`.
3. Ask live docs for the protocol you just declared; this proves that documentation and
   resolution see the same semantic context.
4. Resolve the protocol and call the returned target. Do not guess a source/class/key
   route or edit an authority catalog.

`workspace-service` describes a declared service boundary, not every method on
every workspace Durable Object. A disposable object intentionally addressed by
source/class/key through `workers.resolveDurableObject(...)` instead declares
`effect: { kind: "open" }`; it has no service-declaration admission boundary.
A manifest-declared service may also expose an open method: the live service
declaration supplies the separate `workspace-service:<name>` target requirement.
Provider-owned protected methods instead use
`effect: { kind: "userland-capability", ... }` backed by the same package's
`authority.provides`. Never change a protected method to open merely to bypass a
missing service declaration. Add the live declaration and use
`resolveService(...)`, or keep the object explicitly lifecycle-owned and direct.

### Installed provider/consumer recipe

When the **consumer is installed workspace code** (rather than eval), use this
complete shape. The provider is a context-local Durable Object service and the
consumer is an ordinary disposable worker.

If a suitable service is already present, discover it through live docs and
start at the consumer manifest/code below; do not create a duplicate provider
or edit `meta/vibestudio.yml` merely to demonstrate consumption.

Provider receiver (`workers/local-greeting/index.ts`):

```ts
import { DurableObjectBase, rpc } from "@workspace/runtime/worker";

export class LocalGreetingDO extends DurableObjectBase {
  protected schemaProductionBaseline() {
    return { version: 1, name: "local-greeting-v1" } as const;
  }

  protected createTables(): void {}

  @rpc({
    principals: ["code"],
    effect: { kind: "open" },
    tier: "open",
    sensitivity: "read",
  })
  async greet(): Promise<{ greeting: string }> {
    return { greeting: "hello from the local provider" };
  }
}
```

Live declaration (`meta/vibestudio.yml`):

```yaml
singletonObjects:
  - source: workers/local-greeting
    className: LocalGreetingDO
    key: main
services:
  - source: workers/local-greeting
    name: local-greeting
    title: Local greeting
    action: read local greetings
    description: Read greetings stored in this workspace.
    notability: everyday
    presentation: { domain: automation, verb: see }
    protocols: [example.local-greeting.v1]
    authority:
      principals: [code]
    durableObject: { className: LocalGreetingDO }
```

Consumer manifest fragment (`workers/local-consumer/package.json`):

Manifest request tiers are only `"gated"` and `"critical"`. Do not copy the
provider method's `@rpc` tier `"open"` into the manifest: receiver policy and
requested authority are intentionally different layers.

`requests` describes only effects performed by this installed code. Evaluated child
code is governed by its host-admitted task or mission session, not this manifest.
Unknown fields and malformed entries are always rejected.

```json
{
  "vibestudio": {
    "authority": {
      "provides": [],
      "requests": [
        {
          "capability": "workspace-service:local-greeting",
          "resource": { "kind": "prefix", "prefix": "" },
          "tier": "gated",
          "evidence": "bounded-dynamic"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Consumer receiver (`workers/local-consumer/index.ts`):

```ts
import {
  createWorkerRuntime,
  handleWorkerRpc,
  type ExecutionContext,
  type WorkerEnv,
} from "@workspace/runtime/worker";

let exposedFor: string | null = null;

export default {
  async fetch(request: Request, env: WorkerEnv, _ctx: ExecutionContext) {
    const runtime = createWorkerRuntime(env);
    if (exposedFor !== env.WORKER_ID) {
      runtime.rpc.expose("consumeLocalService", async () => {
        const service = await runtime.workers.resolveService("example.local-greeting.v1");
        if (service.kind !== "durable-object") throw new Error("Expected local DO service");
        return runtime.rpc.call(service.targetId, "greet", []);
      });
      exposedFor = env.WORKER_ID;
    }
    return handleWorkerRpc(runtime, request) ?? new Response("ready");
  },
};
```

The low-level installed-worker `runtime.rpc.call(...)` returns `unknown` unless
the caller supplies a documented result type or uses a typed client. For a
smoke/proof endpoint, return the provider result intact instead of guessing and
projecting fields. If application code needs individual fields, define or
import the provider's public result contract and call
`runtime.rpc.call<ThatResult>(...)`; do not infer a shape from a method name.

Build both units in the same context, ask live docs for
`example.local-greeting.v1`, then exercise the installed consumer through the
normal typed lifecycle. This complete eval shape keeps the build selector,
runtime context, RPC target, and cleanup aligned:

```ts
import { contextId, rpc, workers } from "@workspace/runtime";

const source = "workers/local-consumer";
const report = await services.build.getBuildReport(source, `ctx:${contextId}`);
if (report.status !== "ok") return report;

const handle = await workers.create(source, {
  key: `probe-${crypto.randomUUID()}`,
  contextId,
});
let observed: unknown;
try {
  observed = await rpc.call(handle.targetId, "consumeLocalService", []);
} finally {
  await workers.destroy(handle);
}
return { observed, createdId: handle.id, retiredId: handle.id };
```

Do not replace `services.build.getBuildReport` with an invented helper or raw
`runtime.createEntity`: the explicit build selects the context-local artifact,
and `workers.create` carries that same context through the canonical lifecycle.
The installed request remains only a maximum: the exact live
declaration/provider EV and the ordinary grant or approval path must still admit
the call.

The provider DO and regular-worker consumer may also live in **one worker
package**. Export the DO class and the default worker `fetch` handler from the
same entry file, list that class under `vibestudio.durable.classes`, point the
singleton/service declaration at that same package source, and keep the exact
`workspace-service:<name>` request on the package. Prefer this shape when a task
already owns one disposable worker repository; do not create a second repository
only to imitate the two-directory illustration above.

## Authoring a unit

For a panel, worker, app, extension, or package that performs gated or critical work:

1. Prefer typed runtime APIs. Use live docs to find the operation and its resource
   shape; do not guess a transport method string.
2. Add the narrow request to that unit's checked-in
   `package.json#vibestudio.authority.requests`.
   Add requests only for gated or critical effects. Open methods and host-owned
   runtime lifecycle plumbing are deliberately absent; putting either in a manifest
   is an error because neither is discretionary unit authority.
3. Use the narrowest resource supported by the operation: exact identity, origin,
   domain, or a deliberate prefix. A bare prefix is slash-hierarchical
   (`context` covers `context/panel`, not `contextual`). End a lexical dynamic
   namespace with its separator when names share a reviewed stem
   (`projects/system-test-` covers generated system-test names only). Do not use
   a wildcard to silence a build error.
4. Run an explicit build/typecheck against `ctx:<contextId>`. The build compares and
   seals the reviewed manifest; it must never rewrite it.
5. Exercise the path. If authority is absent, let the typed acquisition flow explain
   or request it. Do not catch `EACCES` and retry through another service, caller, or
   host identity.

Changing code invalidates version-bound grants because authority follows the exact
execution digest. Critical authority is never persistent.

An agent-owned eval is a conduit, not a separately trusted app. A durable choice is
**Always for this agent** and remains keyed to that exact agent binding. This is not an
installed-code update or version decision. Every eval still receives code review before
it can run, and its effects intersect the binding, admitted task or approved mission,
current grants, receiver policy, and context lineage.

## Panel-tree relationship authority

Panel coordination uses two distinct relationships:

- The mutable panel tree is presentation and organization. Reparenting, sorting, or
  nesting a panel does not transfer runtime capabilities.
- Immutable runtime launch ancestry is control provenance. A panel, its bound agent,
  and that agent's EvalDO can control panel runtimes they spawned because the host
  verifies the descendant chain. This relationship check is terminal authorization
  input, not a grant copied between principals.

Consequently, a collection may freely create, move, rename, and coordinate its own
spawned descendants without prompting at every operation. Moving an imported or
unrelated panel under that collection does not make it creator-controlled. Runtime or
CDP control of such a foreign-context target still selects the exact
`context.boundary` decision for that requester and target context. A remembered gated
decision can cover later operations within that same scope; privileged targets remain
critical and require a fresh decision.

Do not propagate capabilities upward to ancestors, downward to arbitrary visual
descendants, or across a reparent operation. If a coordinator needs prompt-free
control, have it spawn the resources it owns. If it adopts existing resources, retain
their provenance and use the ordinary exact context-boundary approval.

## Review and activation lifecycle

Executable workspace units are reviewed as exact build identities, not by package
name alone. The identity includes the unit's source effective version, transitive
workspace dependency versions, relevant external dependency versions, runtime ABI,
and its complete sealed authority contract for direct installed-code `requests`.

- On a fresh workspace, every executable version already present—apps, native
  extensions, panels, workers, and userland Durable Objects owned by those workers—is
  collected into one startup batch when it lacks prior admission. This is one user
  decision with many progressively disclosed unit rows, not one prompt per capability
  or per host. The selected host app owns the bootstrap surface, but it does not approve
  itself: the host resolves the entire batch before activating that exact app version.
- A protected-main publication that changes an executable unit or anything in its
  transitive build closure presents one combined source-and-authority review before
  the head advances. The exact candidate identities accepted by that decision are
  handed directly to activation; activation must not ask the same question again.
- Shared libraries do not receive runtime authority of their own. Changing one changes
  the effective versions of its executable dependents, so those dependent apps,
  extensions, panels, and workers appear in the protected-publication review.
- Added capabilities are shown first in user-facing language. Unchanged capabilities
  stay collapsed under details; removals are summarized. A code-only change therefore
  says that no new permissions are requested without hiding that the exact code version
  is changing.
- Direct installed-code capabilities render as shared authority rows in the
  exact-version review. Evaluated code is not part of that version's authority:
  it enters only through a host-admitted task or approved mission and uses ordinary
  grants or fresh approval.
- A manifest request remains only a maximum. Version review admits the exact installed
  unit to use that maximum at gated tier; action-scoped resources, credentials,
  outside-content trust, and critical operations can still require their own just-in-time
  decision. Those are different consent objects, not duplicate version prompts.
- Denied or dismissed unit versions never activate. A later source edit produces a new
  identity and a new review; no session-duration source-change bypass exists.

Do not add a second approval around build completion, host startup, or runtime
activation. If an exact version was reviewed at protected publication, propagate that
identity through the canonical trust handoff. If it was not reviewed (for example an
existing unit in a newly created workspace), enqueue it in the shared startup batch.

An exact `workspace-service:<name>` request is allowed even when that provider is not
present in the checkout being built. This is an intentional dynamic bound, not an
unused request: the live semantic context supplies the declaration and exact provider
EV later. Installed units may not request `workspace-service:*`; evaluated sessions
select exact live services and cannot turn a wildcard into authority.

## Userland-owned capabilities

When a workspace service owns a protected resource, declare that capability in the
provider manifest's `authority.provides` list and bind each protected method through
extension `methodAuthority` or the Durable Object's `@rpc` effect. Use the receiver
object for simple resources. For prepared state, declare
`produces: { kind: "opaque-handle", capability: "<local-name>" }`, return
`prepareOpaqueHandle(selector, { title, detail? })`, and bind the consumer with
`resource: { kind: "opaque-handle", argument: <index> }`.
The dispatcher enforces the declaration before provider code runs and routes missing
authority through the same trusted acquisition UI used by host capabilities.

Never add an advisory prompt inside provider code. Credentials, network access,
filesystem authority, protected-main publication, panel control, and other host
effects must still cross their own independently protected receivers.

## Content integrity

Content provenance is authority input. File versions and durable channel messages are
stamped at their write chokepoints from the authoring session's monotone latch. Reads
advance the receiving session's latch before bytes become visible. Never accept a
caller-supplied `contentClass` or `externalKeys`, and never copy content through a new
file or message to make it appear internal.

The host represents two or more exact outside sources as one
`lineage-set:<sha256>` coordinate. Its digest covers the canonical sorted leaf
keys, and the content-trust store retains and verifies that exact member list.
Successive ingestion grows one aggregate set monotonically, so listing a large
multi-source tree does not consume one latch slot per source. Treat a lineage
set as an opaque content-addressed fact: workspace code must not invent one,
nest sets, parse its digest as members, or replace it with a lossy domain/count
summary. Host trust and diagnostics expand it through the canonical store;
unknown or digest-mismatched sets fail closed. An exact vouch may name the set,
and applies only to that exact membership.

A bound agent can inspect only lineage already present in its own session with
`contextIntegrity.explain({ key?, cursor?, limit? })`. The host verifies the
set digest before returning a bounded page of exact leaf coordinates and trust
decisions. The cursor is opaque and bound to the set; pagination is a
presentation bound, not truncation of the stored lineage. Directory listing is
an observation and may ingest provenance for returned names, but it must not
fail merely because a large exact tree has more than 256 leaf sources—the host
stores their canonical monotone union as one set coordinate.

If an otherwise valid standing grant is refused after outside content entered the
session, use the authority preflight/approval explanation. The outside lineage is a
fact to preserve, not an error to erase.

## Mission closure

A mission is an immutable, content-addressed authority closure, not a label attached
to an agent. Its charter binds the exact harness EV, hashed skills, exposed host and
workspace services, model settings, trigger, and network policy. Starting a mission
session is allowed only while that exact closure is active.

- Change any closure input by creating a revised mission and obtaining approval for
  that exact revision. Do not mutate a running session or repair a digest in place.
- Preserve the original mission, session, caller, owner, and context lineage through
  every service and RPC leg. A host caller substituted for a failing internal leg is
  an authority escalation.
- Treat standing restrictions as durable deny grants. A later allow, broader manifest,
  or acquisition decision cannot override them.
- Resolve pinned userland providers to exact EVs before approval. A `follow-head`
  provider is an explicit closure policy, not permission to silently widen its methods
  or capabilities.
- Use `workspaceServiceDiscovery: "live-declarations"` only for a reviewed mission
  whose purpose genuinely spans services created after approval. It admits live
  declaration selection into the closure; it grants no service capability. The exact
  provider EV, session grant/acquisition, receiver policy, and
  context integrity still intersect at each call.
- Keep event triggers inside the closed filter grammar. Do not evaluate workspace
  expressions as trigger policy.

Host-shipped seeded missions are reconciled from immutable product snapshot outputs.
Their checked-in JSON is explicit reviewed input; `@seed` is resolved only from the
shipped snapshot. Product reseeding makes an old closure inert before replacing its
grants. Never derive a seed from the mutable workspace tree, and never turn ordinary
workspace code into a product seed.

## Product-owned System Agent

The System Agent is a pinned, product-owned mission and worker, not a privileged copy
of an ordinary workspace agent.

- Its model-facing tool surface remains exactly `eval` and `say`. Shell operations
  happen through typed services inside the ordinary eval runtime.
- Its prompt, handbook, manifest, mission seed, and execution version come from the
  immutable product snapshot. Workspace prompt overrides, skills, memory recall, or
  edited worker code must not widen it.
- Its conversation is host-derived per `(workspace, authenticated user, product
snapshot)`. Callers do not supply user, channel, worker, context, or membership
  identities.
- Its channel has an exact locked roster containing that user and that exact worker
  target. Generic subscription or channel configuration cannot add participants.
- Conversation eval cannot settle approvals, read protected approval payloads,
  activate/renew/widen delegation, alter its own trust root, or extract stored
  credential material. Those require separate human or delegated-policy boundaries.

Do not add a System-Agent-only transport, eval dialect, receiver bypass, or lifecycle
branch. If a shell operation is missing, add the typed semantic service with ordinary
receiver enforcement and review its inclusion in the mission closure.

## Diagnosing a denial

- Search/open the live docs for the exact caller context.
- Confirm the service declaration exists in that semantic context and the resolved
  provider/source is the intended one.
- Use `authority.preflight` before a protected host-service call when the outcome
  is uncertain. Read each leaf's structured `failure.reasonCode` and
  `failure.remediation`; never parse the human error string.
- Treat `missing-grant` and `lineage` with
  `remediation.kind: "request-user-approval"` as dynamically acquirable. An
  interactive agent/session call suspends on the existing acquisition rendezvous
  when its context requests `authorityAcquisition: "wait"`; an installed-code call
  receives `EACQUIRE` plus `errorData.acquisition` so its owning UI can present the
  same user decision. Retry only after that exact acquisition resolves.
- Treat `fixed-code-not-requested` with
  `remediation.kind: "update-installed-code-manifest"` as an immutable installed-code failure,
  not as a promptable permission. For installed panels/workers, add the returned
  exact `remediation.request` to the owning unit manifest and submit the new sealed
  version for review. An admitted eval never repairs a package manifest: it requests
  ordinary interactive authority or, when unattended, proposes a mission revision.
- Treat `receiver-undeclared` with
  `remediation.kind: "declare-rpc-receiver"` as a provider defect. Add the
  appropriate reviewed `@rpc` contract to the receiver or route the operation
  through its declared service/channel API. Caller grants and manifest requests
  cannot authorize an undeclared method.
- Treat relationship, principal, session, denial, and attestation reason codes as
  terminal for that invocation and follow their explicit remediation. Never turn a
  relationship or transport failure into a permission prompt.
- Direct authority attestations are runtime transport internals. Workspace code must
  not import `@vibestudio/rpc/internal`, inspect or forward nonces, or copy a caller
  envelope. Durable Object receivers use the sanitized `this.caller` identity and
  `this.authorization` facts; ordinary calls go through the runtime RPC client.
- Inspect the unit's sealed build metadata and execution digest, not only its mutable
  `package.json`.
- Keep the original caller/session across closure legs. Never replace it with a host
  caller to make an internal leg pass.

Unknown schemas, missing provenance, missing provider declarations, and unclassified
authority fail closed. This is prerelease software: fix the source contract or the
runtime architecture instead of adding compatibility shims or parallel paths.
