# Messaging

There is one messaging primitive: **`notify`**. It is how you speak to the
channel, how you report to a supervisor, how you steer a child, how you reach a
person's phone, and how you talk to an agent in another conversation. If you are
about to write text that someone else should see, `notify` is the tool.

```
notify({
  content: "…",              // markdown
  to?: string | string[],    // addressees; omit for the whole channel
  alert?: "none" | "inbox" | "interrupt",
  title?: string,            // headline for escalated surfaces
  replyTo?: string,
  attachments?: string[],    // image paths in your working tree
})
```

## Who you can address

`to` takes one ref or a list. Omitting it addresses the whole channel.

| Ref | Reaches |
|---|---|
| *(omitted)* | everyone in this conversation |
| `@handle` | one participant here — an agent or a person; a person is also found by handle when they are a workspace member who has not joined this channel yet |
| `participant:<id>` | the same, by exact id |
| `user:<id>` | a specific person, on this channel or not (they are added to it) |
| `owner` | the person this channel belongs to (fails when there is more than one person here — nobody is guessed) |
| `parent` | your supervisor, when you are a subagent |
| `run:<runId>` | a subagent you spawned, in its own task channel |
| `agent:<handle>@<channelId>` | an agent instance in another conversation |
| `channel:<id>` | everyone in another conversation |

Run a `list_addressees` to see exactly these, filled in, for where you are
standing. Every row prints the string `to` accepts — discovery output is notify
input, so there is nothing to translate.

**Unresolvable refs fail the call.** A misspelled handle comes back with
suggestions rather than being broadcast to everyone; a handle that matches two
participants comes back asking which. This is deliberate: guessing is how an
agent tells the wrong person something.

## The alert ladder

Three rungs, each a superset of the one below. They are named for what the
*recipient experiences*, because that is the only thing you can be held to —
not for how urgent the news feels to you.

| Rung | What the person gets | When |
|---|---|---|
| `none` | the message in the channel, nothing else | agent-to-agent, and ordinary channel utterances. The default. |
| `inbox` | + a durable notification entry and a phone push | the default whenever you address a person. It lands and it travels, without seizing a screen. |
| `interrupt` | + a toast on whatever they are doing | only for something they would want to be pulled away from. |

Escalation is **explicit**: an untargeted `notify` is a plain channel message.
A rung above `none` reaches the people you addressed — or, when you raised the
rung on purpose without naming anyone, the people in this conversation. Nobody
outside the conversation is ever guessed at.

What the person sees: a notification-center row (grouped per agent, so two
reports before they look read as one), a phone notification, and — at
`interrupt` — a toast. From any of these they can **reply in place** in a
lightweight conversation view bound to your channel, or open the full chat
panel landed on your message. Reading your message *is* acknowledging it: you
see the ordinary read receipt, and the entry retires. Do not re-notify what
has been read.

Worked examples:

```ts
// A milestone your supervisor should see. No person is addressed, no escalation.
notify({ content: "Fixture landed; verification is green.", to: "parent" });

// A background run finishing while nobody is watching. This is what phones are for.
notify({
  to: "owner",
  title: "Nightly build failed",
  content: "`packages/agent-loop` — 3 tests red since 02:14. [details](…)",
});                                   // alert defaults to "inbox"

// Something that should not wait.
notify({
  to: "owner",
  alert: "interrupt",
  title: "Production deploy is rolling back",
  content: "The 14:20 deploy is reverting. Nothing is lost; it needs a decision.",
});
```

## Etiquette

Notification is cheap. Keep it **rare**.

- **Notable circumstances only.** Report what this conversation has established
  as report-worthy and what the user or your supervisor asked to hear about.
  Turn narration is not a notification.
- **Expectations are addressable state.** "Only tell me when it's done" and
  "keep me posted" both override the defaults above. When you spawn a subagent,
  say in its task what you want to hear about.
- **Steer, don't poll.** `notify({ to: "run:<runId>" })` is for correcting
  course or supplying information the child lacks. Progress is read with
  `inspect_subagent` / `read_subagent` and arrives on terminal delivery.
  Messaging a working child to ask how it is going costs it a turn and buys
  nothing.
- **Prefer addressed over broadcast.** An addressed message wakes exactly who
  should act; a broadcast makes everyone decide whether it was for them.
- **Break ping cycles.** Do not reply to acknowledgments, do not thank, do not
  re-notify what the recipient already acknowledged. If an exchange stops
  producing new information, stop messaging. There is a hop cap underneath you,
  but it is a backstop, not a budget to spend.

## Finding someone to talk to

- `list_addressees` — everyone reachable from where you are: this channel's
  roster, your supervisor, your live runs, and running agents elsewhere.
- `discover_agents({ query })` — search by *purpose*: "gmail triage", "nightly
  builds". Results carry each instance's own latest deliberate message as its
  overview, and print `agent:<handle>@<channelId>` refs ready to paste into
  `notify`.

**Be findable.** The directory searches each instance's handle, name, its
one-line description, and its latest deliberate message. Set the description
yourself with `set_description("…")` — what you are for and what you are doing
here — and update it when that changes materially. An agent with no
description is found only by its handle.

An agent instance is a **(worker, channel) pair**. The same worker sitting in
three conversations is three instances with three refs, because "message the
gmail agent" is meaningless without saying *where*. Addressing a bare
`agent:<handle>` when the worker runs in several channels fails with the list.

Instances that have left their channel stay discoverable with
`includeTerminal`. Their channels are durable, so messaging one wakes it — that
is how you resume a conversation with an agent that finished weeks ago. Status
is `running` / `idle` / `terminal`, flipped by lifecycle events only; `idle`
includes an agent whose process has been evicted — it wakes on your message
exactly like a running one.

## Talking to an agent in another conversation

```ts
notify({
  to: "agent:gmail@ch-inbox-triage",
  content: "Can you extract the newsletter senders from the last 20 messages tagged `newsletters`?",
});
```

The message lands as an ordinary message in *their* channel, marked as coming
from you and from here; they can reply symmetrically — a guest message tells its
recipient the exact `agent:<handle>@<channelId>` ref to answer with. Your own
channel records a reference to it, not a copy — the utterance exists once,
where it was said. Guest messages are not editable after sending.

Two consequences worth knowing:

- The conversation-depth cap travels with the message. A ping-pong across two
  channels is bounded exactly like one inside a single channel.
- A channel with locked membership refuses guests, and says so as a *closed
  channel* rather than as an unknown addressee. Do not retry it.

## What `notify` is not

It does not compel a reply. It makes one *possible* (the recipient is addressed,
so their respond policy can wake them) and *observable* (the message is durable
and the escalation is recorded). Whether anyone answers is theirs to decide.

For a blocking question you cannot continue without, use `ask_user`.
