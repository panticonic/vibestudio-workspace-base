# Agent Tools Reference

Your working directory is the **context folder** — an isolated copy of the workspace.

**CRITICAL RULES:**

- All file paths are **relative to your working directory** (e.g., `panels/my-app/index.tsx`)
- **NEVER** use host absolute paths (e.g., `/home/.../workspace/panels/...`). Runtime `fs.*` accepts context-root absolute paths like `/panels/my-app/index.tsx`, but prefer `panels/my-app/index.tsx` in examples and source edits.
- **NEVER** use `Bash` for git operations, file listing, or file creation — use the structured tools
- In eval, `rpc`, `services`, `fs`, `ctx`, `scope`, `scopes`, `db`, `help` (and, in agent eval, `chat`) are **injected free variables** — do **not** import them. Raw service catalog calls always work as `rpc.call("<svc>.<method>", [args])`; `services.<svc>` is convenience sugar and may be an ergonomic runtime client when the name collides (`services.workers` is `workers`). For workspace/npm **packages**, use a **static import** (`import { createProjects } from "@workspace-skills/workspace-dev"`). Dynamic `await import(...)` may work in some builds, but it bypasses the loader's static dependency planning and is not the supported pattern.

## Filesystem Tools (Native SDK)

### Read

Read file contents.

```
Read({ file_path: "panels/my-app/index.tsx" })
```

### Write

Create or overwrite a file.

```
Write({ file_path: "panels/my-app/index.tsx", content: "..." })
```

### Edit

Edit a file using string replacement.

```
Edit({
  file_path: "panels/my-app/index.tsx",
  old_string: "const [value, setValue] = useState('')",
  new_string: "const [value, setValue] = useState('initial')"
})
```

### Glob

Find files by glob pattern.

```
Glob({ pattern: "**/*.tsx" })
Glob({ pattern: "panels/*/package.json" })
```

### Grep

Search file contents. Grep is literal by default; use that for code snippets,
identifiers, function calls, paths, and punctuation. Set `literal: false` only
when the pattern is an intentional valid regex.

```
Grep({ pattern: "useState", path: "panels/my-app" })
Grep({ pattern: "openPanel(", path: "workspace/packages/runtime" })
Grep({ pattern: "import.*runtime", path: "panels/my-app", literal: false })
```

`Read`, `Glob`/`find`, and `Grep` may use the optional native
`@workspace-extensions/file-tools` accelerator. It is never a liveness
dependency: every invocation has a 15-second deadline, inherits tool
cancellation, and falls back to the context filesystem (or the host
filesystem service for grep). A fallback is announced as tool progress and
recorded in `details.extensionFallback` with the exact operation and reason,
for example `file-tools find timed out after 15000ms`. Do not wait on or retry
a stalled helper; continue from the successful fallback result. Abort remains
an abort and is never converted into a fallback.

The context filesystem transport has no invented per-operation deadline. Its
RPC remains owned by the enclosing tool/run and follows that caller's explicit
cancellation. A slow valid filesystem operation therefore cannot be relabeled
as an infrastructure failure merely because a fixed wall-clock threshold
elapsed. This is distinct from a normal missing path (a successful discovery
diagnostic) and from explicit tool cancellation.

The 15-second values above and below bound one replaceable optimization or one
durably retried delivery attempt; they are not RPC operation deadlines. The
logical filesystem operation, eval run, system-test run, and durable delivery
remain alive under caller cancellation or durable state respectively.

Ordinary in-process agent tools have no implicit wall-clock deadline. They run
for as long as their work requires and receive cancellation only when the
owning agent turn is explicitly cancelled. A tool or deferred protocol may own
an explicit deadline when that deadline is part of its semantics; for example,
`eval` accepts an opt-in `timeoutMs` and delivers long-running results
asynchronously.

Channel trajectory terminals and other structured envelopes use a durable
delivery outbox with a 15-second transport attempt deadline. An unavailable
or wedged participant therefore releases the channel alarm, records the exact
delivery failure, and retries from the outbox; it cannot indefinitely block
the caller's terminal tool result or unrelated channel work.

Protected publication settles the package graph and effective-version index
before speculative cache warming. Resolving or opening a newly published unit
therefore waits only for its graph identity and its own on-demand build; a slow
unrelated background build cannot make the new unit disappear or stall every
filesystem/VCS request behind global build settlement.

---

## Creating Projects

Create new projects via eval. Workspace skill packages are auto-resolved — just write the `import` statement.

Supported types: `panel`, `package`, `skill`, `project`, `worker`. Each scaffolds into its repo directory (`panels/`, `packages/`, `skills/`, `projects/`, `workers/`). The `skill` type is for a standalone cross-repo skill package. Do not use `projectType: "skill"` to document an existing package, worker, panel, extension, or project.

The scaffold runs the semantic development loop for you: it authors one
coherent lifecycle work unit, commits the complete local chain from the exact
working head, and publishes the resulting event through semantic
ancestry/integration validation, the affected-unit build/typecheck gate,
approval, and an atomic protected-ref update. Post-publication build and
activation remain separate projections, and failed activation retains the
previous runnable artifact.
Follow-up `edit`/`write` changes remain context-local until you commit the
complete chain and choose to publish it.

Do **not** use `createProjects` for a context-local temporary repo that might
never be published. A repo path is established by writing any file inside it:
`write`/`edit` to `projects/tmp-name/note.md` is enough. You may leave that work
on the context's working head, commit the local chain as a context event, or
publish that event when it should become visible on
`main`.

### Project-Specific Skill Docs

Any workspace repo can include a top-level `SKILL.md` that is discovered as an
agent skill. For guidance tied to one repo, add or edit that repo's own file
instead of creating a separate `skills/<name>` repo.

Examples:

- `packages/data-model/SKILL.md` for package APIs, schemas, and test commands
- `workers/customer-agent/SKILL.md` for worker behavior, queues, and diagnostics
- `panels/chat/SKILL.md` for panel-specific UI conventions
- `extensions/browser-data/SKILL.md` for extension setup and operational notes
- `projects/customer-vault/SKILL.md` for a plain content repo's structure

Use `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` only for cross-repo workflows or reusable skill
packages. The built-in onboarding skill stays in `skills/onboarding/SKILL.md`
because it describes the whole workspace. Read repo-local skills using the path
shown in the skill index, such as `read("packages/data-model/SKILL.md")`.

### Usage

When building related units — a panel and its backing DO store, for example —
create them together with `createProjects` so the user sees one consolidated
approval prompt instead of separate prompts for each:

```
eval({ code: `
  import { createProjects, searchProjectCatalog } from "@workspace-skills/workspace-dev";
  const [databaseCatalog, panelCatalog] = await Promise.all([
    searchProjectCatalog({ resource: "icon", query: "database", limit: 5 }),
    searchProjectCatalog({ resource: "icon", query: "panels top left", limit: 5 }),
  ]);
  const databaseIcon = databaseCatalog.entries[0]?.id;
  const panelIcon = panelCatalog.entries[0]?.id;
  if (!databaseIcon || !panelIcon) throw new Error("Required catalog icons are unavailable");
  return await createProjects([
    { projectType: "worker", name: "task-board-store", title: "Task Board Store", icon: databaseIcon },
    { projectType: "panel", name: "task-board", title: "Task Board", icon: panelIcon },
  ]);
`
})
```

Even for a single project, use `createProjects` with a one-element array.

**`createProjects(projects)` parameters (per project):**
| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `projectType` | string | Yes | One of: `panel`, `package`, `skill`, `project`, `worker` |
| `name` | string | Yes | Stable kebab-case identifier matching `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]*$` |
| `title` | string | No | Human-readable title (defaults to name) |
| `icon` | string | No | Emoji, local relative asset, or an exact catalog entry id returned by `searchProjectCatalog({ resource: "icon", query })` |
| `template` | string | No | Panel template name, or `agentic` for the agentic worker scaffold |

Do not guess catalog names from the full upstream Lucide or Simple Icons
libraries: the scaffold deliberately accepts a small curated set. Call
`searchProjectCatalog({ resource: "icon", query, limit })` and choose an exact
entry id. An invalid catalog id throws `ProjectIconError` before any VCS
mutation, with the exact bounded query/result, suggestions, and recovery in
`errorData`.

The typed catalog result records the resource, normalized query, total count,
bounded entries, and truncation count. Pass an entry's exact `id` directly.
`listProjectIcons()` remains the unbounded convenience read when every icon is
genuinely needed.

For an isolated generated name, append a lowercase base-36 suffix such as
`` `todo-list-${Date.now().toString(36)}` ``. Do not append a raw ISO timestamp:
its uppercase `T`/`Z`, colons, and periods are not valid repository identity.

`createProjects` returns an array of results, one per project.
Each result includes
`{ created, files, preflight, publication }`.
`preflight` is the mutation-free proof that the complete planned repository
passed the canonical manifest and source checks. Both fresh scaffolds and forks
must pass it; there is no legacy-fork bypass.
`publication.published` is `true` and the remaining fields name the exact
committed/published event, new main, durable effect, and application time.

Module dependency validation is one shared platform contract, not a
`forkProject` regex. It recognizes static imports/exports, literal dynamic
imports, and literal `require` calls while excluding comments, embedded source
examples, regular expressions, Node built-ins, and self-references.
Production value imports belong in `dependencies` (or `peerDependencies`);
test-only and type-only imports may use `devDependencies`. For type-only
imports, the matching `@types` coordinate is accepted.

On failure, inspect the structured `ProjectPreflightError.errorData`:

- `code: "project_preflight_failed"` and `stage: "dependency-contract"`;
- `projectType`, `projectName`, and canonical `packageName`;
- `issues[].code` (`dependency_missing` or `dependency_wrong_field`);
- the `coordinate`, `expectedField`, optional `declaredField`, and
  `acceptedCoordinates`; and
- every source occurrence with `file`, `specifier`, `kind`, `syntax`,
  `line`, and `column`, plus an actionable `remediation`.

This packet is the repair plan. Do not probe unrelated fork sources after a
canonical source reports a dependency defect.

Forking owns `package.json` through a structural manifest rewrite: package name,
entry, title, and Durable Object class metadata are updated as typed fields.
Generic worker source-string replacement never runs over the rewritten
manifest, including when the destination name contains the source name as a
prefix (for example `source` → `source-copy`). Run `dryRun: true` first and
inspect `preflight`, `rewrites`, and `warnings`; use `classMap` for workers with
multiple Durable Object classes.

If protected publication fails after commit, the helper throws
`ScaffoldPublicationError`; eval shows its `errorData` in the tool details.
`errorData` contains:

- `code: "scaffold_publication_failed"` and `stage: "push"`;
- `created`, `files`, `committedEventId`, and `published: false`;
- the exact original `publicationRequest`;
- `vcsError.code`, message, and original typed data; and
- `retry.commandIdPolicy`.

Do not rerun `createProjects`, because the repositories and commit already exist.
First branch on `retry.commandIdPolicy`. For
`reuse-identical-only-if-outcome-uncertain` or
`reobserve-status-and-use-new-command`, use the receipt-driven recovery helper:

```ts
import { recoverProjectPublication } from "@workspace-skills/workspace-dev";
return await recoverProjectPublication(scaffoldError);
```

It calls `vcs.status`, refuses if the context is not clean at the exact recorded
commit, reuses the original command only for an identical uncertain external
effect, and otherwise uses a fresh command against the newly observed main.
For `repair-source-and-recommit`, do not call the recovery helper: consume every
`BuildGateFailed` diagnostic, edit the existing repository, rebuild the exact
context, commit a new event, and publish it from fresh status. The helper rejects
this policy explicitly because retrying source-invalid bytes cannot succeed.
`ScaffoldPublicationRecoveryError.errorData` says whether another recovery call
is safe; it never recreates files or commits. A malformed or mismatched
publication receipt records `stop-integrity-investigation` and is never
auto-recovered.

## eval

Execute TypeScript/JavaScript code server-side in your own notebook sandbox (a
per-agent EvalDO). It runs even when no panel is open. The same live heap is
retained for 30 minutes after the latest cell; every cell renews the lease.
After an unavoidable restart, `[kernel] Restarted` reports exact restored and
lost scope keys. In eval, `rpc`, `services`, `fs`, `ctx`, `scope`, `scopes`,
`db`, `help` (and, in agent eval, `chat`) are injected free variables; reach
raw service catalog methods through `rpc.call("<svc>.<method>", [args])`. Use
rich runtime bindings (`workers`, `vcs`, `fs`, etc.) directly for normal
workspace operations; `services.<svc>` is convenience sugar for non-colliding
service names. Do **not** import the injected names from `@workspace/runtime`.

**IMPORTANT:**

- Use static `import` syntax for **packages** (workspace/npm). Dynamic `await import(...)` is a fallback only for ordinary browser/ESM code; do not use it for workspace packages.

**Parameters:**
| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `code` | string | Yes | Code to execute |
| `syntax` | `"javascript"` \| `"typescript"` \| `"tsx"` \| `"jsx"` | No | Syntax mode (default: `"tsx"`) |
| `imports` | `Record<string, string>` | No | Packages to build on-demand. Workspace packages: `"latest"` or a git ref. npm packages: `"npm:<version>"` (e.g. `"npm:^4.17.21"`, `"npm:latest"`) |
| `timeoutMs` | positive integer | No | Optional wall-clock deadline in milliseconds; omitted means no deadline |

For inline code with relative imports, `sourcePath` (or the inline `path` hint)
is the virtual location of the eval module. It is not the module being imported:
to import `./index.ts`, use its directory or a distinct filename such as
`src/eval-check.ts`, not `src/index.ts` (which would be a self-import).

### Panel APIs

`createPanelSlot`/`openPanel`/`getPanelHandle`/`panelTree` are part of the **portable runtime surface** — importable from `@workspace/runtime` (and injected ambiently) in panel, worker, **and server-side eval**. They are host-mediated over RPC: in eval they create/inspect panels via the server. To change a panel's state from eval, use the returned `PanelHandle.stateArgs.set/get`; do not resolve the internal `workspace.state` service yourself. A handful of panel-only extras (`panel.focusPanel`, `buildPanelLink`, `panel.reopen`, `panel.stateArgs`, `adblock`, `journal.Journal`, `agentApi`) are NOT in the eval surface — those need a real panel host:

| API                              | Description                                                                                                                                                            |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `createPanelSlot(source, opts?)` | Commit an unloaded panel and return its durable handle without allocating a presentation lease or waiting for application readiness                                    |
| `openPanel(source, opts?)`       | Open any panel — URLs become browser panels, source paths open workspace panels (eval too); readiness is observed until ready, failed, stopped, or caller cancellation |
| `buildPanelLink(source, opts)`   | Build a URL for panel navigation (panel/component code — not in eval)                                                                                                  |
| `panel.focusPanel(panelId)`      | Focus an existing panel by ID (panel/component code — not in eval)                                                                                                     |
| `panel.switchContext(id, opts?)` | Explicitly move this panel to an already-created workspace branch; state args cannot select a context                                                                  |

`await openPanel(...)` returns only after the exact runtime attempt is
application boot-ready; resolve/build/host/boot failures reject with
`PanelOperationError` and structured provenance. The underlying tree slot is
committed immediately and its build/host/boot lifecycle continues
asynchronously, so a broken panel cannot block owner seeding or unrelated tree
operations; the public promise observes that lifecycle without inventing a
wall-clock failure. Pass an `AbortSignal` when the caller owns cancellation. Use
`createPanelSlot(...)` when the operation's authoritative result is the
committed navigation receipt and observe the returned handle separately if
readiness matters. Pass a stable `operationId` whenever the surrounding
workflow may retry so creation resolves to the same durable slot.
The retry identity also includes `source`, `contextId`, `parentId`, and `ref`;
an exact retry resumes the existing slot while a logically different open gets
a different identity. Do not combine `operationId` with `slug`. All
readiness-bearing handle methods accept caller cancellation: pass `{ signal }`
to `snapshot`, `reload`, and `rebuild`, or include `signal` in the existing
options for `navigate` and `focus`.

`openPanel(source)` creates a new panel for
main/pushed code. To run code from the current context branch, pass
`ref: \`ctx:${ctx.contextId}\``explicitly (and usually`contextId: ctx.contextId`for matching storage).`contextId` alone only selects
the panel's filesystem/storage context; it does not select code.

In **eval**, `rpc` is the same portable client shape used by panels and workers:
`rpc.call(target, method, args)`. Raw server services target `"main"`, for
example `rpc.call("main", "build.getBuild", ["panels/my-app"])` or
`chat.rpc.call("main", "build.recompute", [])`.

### Using extensions

Extensions are **declared** in `meta/vibestudio.yml` under `extensions:`. That declaration is the only way to add or remove one. To start using an extension, add it to the `extensions:` list in `meta/vibestudio.yml`; saving that change (a gated meta write) raises one joint approval covering every newly-declared extension. Once approved and running, call it. **From eval**, invoke an extension method via
`services.extensions.invoke(name, "method", [args])` (the underlying RPC); list
availability with `rpc.call("main", "extensions.list", [])`. **In panel/component code**,
use the typed client `extensions.use(name)` instead (panel-runtime sugar over the
same RPC). Individual extension methods can still request their own approvals when
the operation needs one, such as running tests.

`extensions.list()` rows expose `name` (the canonical scoped package name),
`shortName` (for example `test-runner`), and `source.repo` (for example
`extensions/test-runner`). Invocation accepts any of those identifiers; prefer
the canonical name in durable code and docs.

The panel-runtime `extensions.use(name)` is synchronous and returns a method
proxy; do not `await` it and do not call `.catch(...)` on it. Catch the method
call instead: `await extensions.use(name).method(...).catch(...)`. The eval form
`services.extensions.invoke(name, "method", [args])` returns the result promise
directly — `.catch(...)` it as usual. Either form fails with `ENOEXT` if the
extension is not declared, or `ENOTREADY` if it is still starting. If you need an
extension that isn't declared yet, edit `meta/vibestudio.yml`.

Extension methods normally use unary RPC and must return JSON-serializable values. If an extension method returns a `Response` or `ReadableStream`, declare it when creating the client so the runtime uses streaming RPC end-to-end. Streaming `Response`/`ReadableStream` methods need the panel-runtime typed client (`extensions.use`), so this runs in panel/component code, not server-side eval:

```tsx
import { extensions } from "@workspace/runtime";

type ShellApi = {
  attach(sessionId: string): Promise<Response>;
  write(sessionId: string, data: string): Promise<void>;
};

const shell = extensions.use<ShellApi>("@workspace-extensions/shell", {
  streamingMethods: ["attach"],
});
```

To check whether an extension is available before calling it from eval, list the registry with `rpc.call("main", "extensions.list", [])`:

```ts
eval({
  code: `
  const name = "@workspace-extensions/image-service";
  const entry = (await rpc.call("main", "extensions.list", [])).find((e) => e.name === name);
  if (!entry || entry.status !== "running") {
    throw new Error(name + " is not available — declare it in meta/vibestudio.yml and approve it.");
  }
`,
});
```

If an extension isn't declared, adding it to `meta/vibestudio.yml` raises a joint approval. If the user denies it, stop and report that the extension is required for the requested operation.

#### Shell command execution

Use the shell extension's `exec` method for a finite command whose complete
stdout/stderr belongs in one structured result. Prefer argv mode
(`shell: false`) so arguments are not reinterpreted by `/bin/sh`:

```ts
const result = await services.extensions.invoke("@workspace-extensions/shell", "exec", [
  {
    command: "/usr/bin/printf",
    args: ["hello from argv mode"],
    shell: false,
    timeoutMs: 5_000,
    maxOutputBytes: 64 * 1024,
  },
]);
return result;
```

The request fields are `command`, `args`, `cwd`, `env`, `shell`, `timeoutMs`,
`stdin`, `maxOutputBytes`, and optionally `contextId` plus a freshly issued
`contextAttachToken`. Do not use `timeout`, `cancelled`, or a shell command
string as aliases. The result is `{ exitCode, stdout, stderr, durationMs,
timedOut?, truncated? }`.

`exec` is protected by the shell extension's manifest-declared
`native.shell.execute` capability. The attributed panel, worker, DO, or agent
eval remains the authority principal even though the native extension performs
the spawn. A call that cannot acquire authority is an attribution/propagation
defect; do not work around it with a temporary panel or another process path.

**Pre-injected** (use directly, do NOT import):

| Variable    | Description                                    |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `contextId` | Current agent context ID for scoped operations |

### RPC Services

From eval, prefer the ergonomic runtime clients (`workers`, `vcs`, `fs`, etc.)
for normal workspace operations. Use raw `rpc.call("<svc>.<method>", [args])`
when following a `docs_open` service catalog entry exactly. `services.<svc>` is
a convenience namespace for non-colliding service names, but rich runtime
bindings win on collision: `services.workers` is the same ergonomic `workers`
client, not the raw `workers` service catalog.

#### Worker lifecycle (portable typed client)

Launch, list, and retire regular workers through the portable typed `workers`
client. It is available to panels, workers, DOs, and eval and delegates to the
canonical runtime entity API. Raw `runtime.*` calls remain available for
advanced and non-worker entity operations.

```
// Launch a worker — `key` names the instance
eval({ code: `
  const handle = await workers.create("workers/my-worker", {
    key: "my-worker",
    contextId: ctx.contextId,
  });
  scope.workerId = handle.id; // e.g. "worker:workers/my-worker:my-worker"
  console.log("Worker started:", handle.id, "→ target", handle.targetId);
`
})

// List running workers
eval({ code: `
  const list = await workers.list();
  console.log(list.map(w => w.id + " (" + w.source + ")"));
`
})

// Retire (stop) a worker — pass the id from the launch handle (or listEntities)
eval({ code: `
  await workers.destroy(scope.workerId);
`
})
```

`contextId` selects both the worker's runtime state partition and its default
semantic working state. Omit `ref` to follow the owning context. Pass
`ref: "main"` only when intentionally pinning protected main, or another exact
selector when deliberately testing a different semantic state.

Launch/list/retire: `workers.create(source, { key, contextId, env, stateArgs, ref? })` returns a handle (`{ id, targetId, … }`); `workers.list()` lists live regular worker **instances**; `workers.destroy(handleOrId)` retires one. `build.listUnits()` is the declared-source/build-readiness view, while `runtime.supervision.list()` returns exact live driver identities; neither replaces worker instance handles. Discover sources with `workers.listSources()` and use each row's `entry` instead of guessing `index.ts`. The raw `runtime.createEntity/listEntities/retireEntity` methods are the canonical entity-lifecycle lower layer. A successful create proves `env` configuration was accepted, while value observation requires a narrow worker endpoint/RPC for a named non-secret probe. The `workers` binding also exposes service resolution — `listServices()`, `resolveService(...)`, `resolveDurableObject(...)`, `durableObjectService(...)`. Prefer `resolveService(...)`; raw resolution can address workspace worker DO classes, while host-internal DOs are not workspace targets and cannot be discovered by guessing. To duplicate or tear down a whole context's durable state (every DO's storage + the file snapshot), use `runtime.cloneContext({ sourceContextId, include? })` → `{ contextId, entities }` and `runtime.destroyContext({ contextId })` — both gated by the context-boundary capability; the low-level cloneDO/destroyDO primitives are server-internal. See [WORKERS.md](WORKERS.md) for details.

For app data, prefer a Durable Object service over eval `db` or ad hoc files:
the DO owns SQLite through `this.sql`, the live service declaration sets
`authority.principals`, and each method declares its `@rpc` receiver policy.
Callers use `workers.resolveService(protocol, objectKey?)` plus
`rpc.call(targetId, method, args)`. See
[WORKERS.md](WORKERS.md#durable-object-backed-app-databases).

#### Semantic workspace version control

Workspace VCS is one semantic graph. A state is a committed event or a local
work application; repositories, paths, and file listings are views over that
state. Commands, work units, changes, applications, decisions, events, files,
and content mappings are directly walkable.

Read the canonical [Vibestudio VCS skill](../vibestudio-vcs/SKILL.md) before
using this surface. Its references define state nodes, merge decisions,
whole-chain commit/discard, file identity, counteractions, provenance reads,
and typed recovery.

Core routing:

| Intent                       | Runtime surface                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Orient in a context          | `vcs.status()` uses the runtime's bound semantic context and returns committed event, working head, main relation, and local counts                                                  |

Every context mutation includes `contextId`, `expectedWorkingHead`, and a stable
`commandId`. A command ID identifies
one canonical request digest. Retry the identical request with the same ID only
when completion is uncertain; after changing any field or receiving a freshness
failure, observe again and use a new ID.

Comparison returns source changes classified as shared, already satisfied,
adoptable, convergent, composed, conflicted, or resolved. Merge bounded stable-coordinate pages and continue from
each returned working head. Commit accepts no selection: it consumes the whole
local chain. Use another context when work needs an independent commit boundary.
An integration commit names the exact source event only after its touched
changes are accounted for. Push creates no ancestry event.

Managed file operations are semantic operations. Prefer the explicit batch
forms for refactors: moves preserve identity across paths and repositories;
copies mint identity while preserving copy ancestry. Managed runtime
`fs.rename`/`fs.copyFile` and agent `move_file`/`copy_file` are acceptable
because the adapter resolves exact identity and routes through these commands
before projection. A shell copy or delete-plus-create
cannot express those facts.

Workspace skill discovery follows the same rule. Runtime
`workspace.listSkills()` and `workspace.readSkill(path)` read through the
caller's verified ambient context. The terminal CLI uses
`vibestudio agent skills ... --session NAME`, which supplies that durable
session's exact context explicitly. Neither surface falls back to checkout
files. Catalog reads query top-level `SKILL.md` files directly and bound
semantic receiver fan-out, so a large workspace cannot turn prompt setup into
an unbounded burst of control-plane calls.

Branch on result/error discriminants such as `RevisionChanged`,
`CoupledGroupIncomplete`, `ConflictPresent`, `IntegrationIncomplete`,
`ScopeTooLarge`, and `IntegrityFailure`.
Explanatory text is for humans, not control flow. Preserve the user's semantic
goal across recovery, but rederive applicability, liveness, dependencies, and
publication reachability at the newly observed working head.

For panel and worker forks, prefer `forkPanel({ from, name, ... })` and
`forkWorker({ from, name, ... })`. They own the destination section and remove
the possibility of accidentally planning a worker under `projects/`; isolation
comes from `dryRun: true`, not from changing project type. Use generic
`forkProject` only when the destination path/project type is deliberately part
of an advanced lifecycle operation. Use `vcs.copy` when the desired fact is
specifically a set of file copies with explicit ancestry. Dry-run unfamiliar
worker forks and provide a `classMap` when multiple Durable Object classes
exist.

#### services.build.getBuildReport (recommended)

Compile a panel against the current context working head and return the
canonical structured build report. Pass the panel source path and the exact
context ref. The report contains `status`, top-level `diagnostics`, and
per-target `builds`; diagnostics include source, severity, file, line, column,
message, and optional source context. The routine report intentionally omits
artifact manifests so compiler feedback remains compact and structurally
available through eval. Each target includes its immutable `buildKey`; use
build provenance or metadata inspection only when artifact details are needed.

```
eval({ code: `
  return await services.build.getBuildReport(
    "panels/my-app",
    \`ctx:\${ctx.contextId}\`,
  );
`
})
```

This local check neither creates a semantic event nor publishes source. It is
the fast repair loop used before commit; the protected push gate repeats the
same check against the exact candidate. Fix every reported file through
managed edits, then request a new report for the same context.

#### @workspace-extensions/typecheck-service (alternative)

Installed panels, workers, extensions, and admitted eval sessions may invoke
`@workspace-extensions/typecheck-service.checkPanel` or its lower-level `check`
method. Prefer `services.build.getBuildReport` in eval because it is the
canonical build result used by panel launch and includes every build target.

`checkPanel` returns `{ diagnostics, errorCount, warningCount }` and infers the
installed caller's context. Pass `{ contextId }` only when intentionally
checking a different context.

#### @workspace-extensions/test-runner.run

Agents run Vitest tests through the first-class verification boundary. It
materializes the exact conversation context and preserves authority, progress,
cancellation, and bounded structured evidence. Test execution goes through the
approval service because tests are code execution.

```
verify({ operation: "test", target: "packages/my-lib" })
```

For a single file or test name:

```
verify({
  operation: "test",
  target: "packages/my-lib",
  file: "src/index.test.ts",
  testName: "handles empty input"
})
```

A failed run or zero discovered tests is an explicit error result with its
structured report intact. Do not replace this boundary with generic `eval`, a
shell command, or direct `extensions.invoke` plumbing.

### Browser Data

| `listOpenTabs`, `openTabsAsPanels`                                                                                       | Preview source tabs and open selected HTTP(S) tabs as panels |

| `getPasswords`, `getPasswordForSite`, password mutation methods                                                          | Manage saved credentials                                     |
| `getFormFillSuggestions` and form-fill mutation methods                                                                  | Manage structured non-payment form-fill values               |

Use `await help("browserData")` for the complete live surface. Site permissions
are approval records, not browser-data records, and imported profiles and paths
are never exposed.

`startImport` is source-keyed and deterministic. Repeat imports update changed
records and add new records without duplicating canonical data.
The runtime client always uses the manifest-selected broker: imported history
and visits recorded by Vibestudio are rows in the same canonical BrowserDataDO.
Do not resolve or call BrowserDataDO directly from a panel or worker.
`openTabsAsPanels` is an action and creates panels on each call. Its default
destination is a new workspace root containing one collection per imported
browser window; pass `destination: "caller"` to attach it to the invoking panel.

#### Discover import sources

```
eval({ code: `
  import { browserData } from "@workspace/runtime";
  const hosts = await browserData.listImportHosts();
  for (const host of hosts) {
    console.log(host.displayName, await browserData.listImportSources(host.hostId));
  }
`
})
```

#### Import from Chrome

```
eval({ code: `
  import { browserData } from "@workspace/runtime";
  const hosts = await browserData.listImportHosts();
  const host = hosts.find(h => h.connected);
  if (!host) { console.log("No import host connected"); return; }
  const sources = await browserData.listImportSources(host.hostId);
  const chrome = sources.find(source => source.browser === "chrome");
  if (!chrome) { console.log("Chrome not found"); return; }
  const job = await browserData.startImport({
    hostId: host.hostId,
    sourceId: chrome.sourceId,
    dataTypes: ["bookmarks", "history", "cookies"],
  });
  console.log("Import job:", job.jobId, job.phase);
`
})
```

#### Search and export

```
eval({ code: `
  import { browserData } from "@workspace/runtime";
  const bookmarks = await browserData.searchBookmarks("github");
  console.log("Found", bookmarks.length, "bookmarks");
  const html = await browserData.exportBookmarks("html");
  console.log("Exported", html.length, "bytes of HTML");
`
})
```

### Panel Lifecycle

`openPanel` and panel handles are host-mediated over RPC and work in panel,
worker, **and server-side eval** (they're part of the portable runtime surface).
You can drive panel lifecycle from eval, panel code, or an
`inline_ui`/`feedback_custom` component:

#### First launch

```tsx
import { openPanel } from "@workspace/runtime";
// Opens the main/pushed build. Plain openPanel() does not infer code provenance
// from your contextId; pass { ref: `ctx:${contextId}` } when intended.
const handle = await openPanel("panels/my-app");
const observation = await handle.observe();
const snapshot = await handle.snapshot();
return { panelId: handle.id, observation, snapshot };
```

`openPanel()` resolving and `observation.phase === "ready"` establish boot
readiness only. They are not rendered verification. Never report a
create/fork/open/rebuild task as successful until `snapshot()` returns rendered
content for the same `panelId`, `attemptId`, `runtimeEntityId`, and `buildKey`.

#### Rebuild after edits

```tsx
import { openPanel } from "@workspace/runtime";
// Rebuilds the panel's current build ref: explicit ref if the panel was pinned,
// otherwise main. It does not infer ctx:<contextId> from the panel context.
const handle = await openPanel("panels/my-app");
const observation = await handle.rebuild();
console.log(observation.phase, observation.effectiveVersion, observation.buildKey);
```

When iterating on an already-open panel after code changes, keep its live handle
and stable id together:

```ts
const handle = scope.panelHandle ?? getPanelHandle(scope.panelId);
scope.panelHandle = handle; // live across cells while this EvalDO kernel is warm
scope.panelId = handle.id; // durable identity for cold recovery
const observation = await handle.rebuild();
```

The live notebook heap is not replaced after each eval; its idle lease lasts 30
minutes from the latest cell. Its durable recovery snapshot contains only exact
data and never reconstructs class instances, so a restarted kernel rehydrates
`panelId` and reports `panelHandle` as lost. Reconstruct from the id only in
that case. Reopening the source instead creates duplicates and can evict the
panel you meant to inspect. `rebuild()` transactionally prepares a new immutable attempt,
activates it without adding a history entry, and waits for its boot handshake.
It is target-only and does not recurse into children. `handle.reload()` reloads
the current renderer and also waits for boot-ready.

Lifecycle calls return `PanelObservation`, including `phase`, `attemptId`,
`runtimeEntityId`, `requestedRef`, `effectiveVersion`, and `buildKey`. Use
`handle.observe()` for a cheap current read, `handle.diagnose()` for a bounded
post-mortem packet, and `handle.snapshot().document` for rendered content tied
to the observed attempt. A ready observation without a matching snapshot is an
incomplete verification result, not permission to claim that the panel works.
