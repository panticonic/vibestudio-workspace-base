# Sandbox Execution Skill

How to use the sandbox — the `eval` tool (which runs code **server-side** in your
own per-agent `EvalDO`), inline UI components, custom feedback forms, and all
runtime APIs they can access. `eval` runs server-side and does not require a
connected panel; `inline_ui`/`load_action_bar`/`feedback_*` render in the chat
panel.

These links are workspace files. Open one with the `read` tool, for example
`read({ path: "skills/sandbox/RUNTIME_API.md" })`. `docs_search` searches the
live API catalog and accepts `{ query: "..." }`; it never opens a file path.

For workspace server host logs, use the separate
[server-logs](../server-logs/SKILL.md) skill. It covers the read-only
`serverLog` service, bounded queries, and live following through
`server-log:append` or the `about/server-logs` viewer.

## Execution Modes

All code runs through the same compile pipeline (Sucrase transform + CJS
execution). **`eval` executes server-side in your per-agent `EvalDO`** (a
Durable Object) — it does not run in the panel and does not require a connected
panel. **`inline_ui`/`load_action_bar`/`feedback_custom` render React in the
chat panel** (panel-only). Eval/UI tools accept either raw `code` or a
context-relative `path` where noted; file-loaded sources support static relative
imports and infer bare package imports from the nearest `package.json` when
possible. The execution modes differ in presentation:

| Tool              | Where it runs          | Rendering                          | Lifecycle                                           | Response                             |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `eval`            | server-side (`EvalDO`) | imperative (run + return)          | activation-resident heap + durable exact scope/`db` | immediate (result to agent)          |
| `inline_ui`       | panel                  | component (render React)           | persistent (in chat history)                        | none (fire-and-forget)               |
| `load_action_bar` | panel                  | component from file (render React) | persistent (top of current panel)                   | immediate tool result                |
| `feedback_custom` | panel                  | component (render React)           | transient                                           | deferred (blocks until user submits) |

Perspective matters. In agent eval, `panelTree.self()` is the EvalDO runtime,
not the visible chat panel. Use `parent`/`getParent()` and
bounded `panelTree.roots()`/`panelTree.children()`/`panelTree.search()` when the user refers to a
visible parent, sibling, or child panel, then read that panel's `stateArgs` to find its
`channelName`/`channelId` before running GAD or channel diagnostics.

Storage matters too. The eval `db` is private to the agent's EvalDO. For
application data that panels, apps, workers, or other agents must share, build a
worker Durable Object with `DurableObjectBase` + `this.sql`, declare it as a
manifest service, and call it through `workers.resolveService(...)` + `rpc.call(...)`.
See [workspace-dev/WORKERS.md](../workspace-dev/WORKERS.md#durable-object-backed-app-databases).

## Injected Variables

The two surfaces inject **different** variables, because eval runs server-side
and components render in the panel:

- **`eval`** (server-side): `rpc`, `services`, `fs`, `ctx`, `scope`, `scopes`,
  `db`, and `help` are injected as free variables — use them directly, do NOT
  `import` them, and do NOT `import` them from `@workspace/runtime` (the eval
  engine rejects importing the pre-injected names). See
  [EVAL.md](EVAL.md#injected-variables). When eval runs as an **agent** (bound
  to a channel), `chat` is injected too (see [EVAL.md](EVAL.md#chat-agent-eval));
  CLI/panel eval has no channel and gets no `chat`.
- **`inline_ui` / `load_action_bar` components** (panel): receive
  `{ props, chat }`. `feedback_custom` components receive
  `{ onSubmit, onCancel, onError, chat }`. They do NOT receive `scope`/`scopes`
  — the eval REPL scope is server-side and is not shared into rendered
  components. Inside a component, reach runtime services via `chat.rpc.call(...)`
  (see [CHAT_API.md](CHAT_API.md)).

For panel identity inside components, use `panel.slotId` for panel-tree
operations and PubSub/channel clients. `rpc.selfId` is the current live runtime
entity and can change after a panel navigation or reopen.

## People, Presence, and Runtime Identity

Do not infer the user account from `agent.describe()` or another runtime
identity. An agent/runtime identity describes the executing participant;
`services.account.getProfile()` returns the verified user subject for the
current authenticated call by default.

These APIs answer different questions:

- `services.account.getProfile()` — the current durable user identity.
- `services.account.listWorkspaceMembers()` — durable workspace membership and
  roles, including members who are offline.
- `services.workspacePresence.list()` — live human connections across the
  current workspace; an empty array is valid.
- `chat.getParticipants()` — participants in the current conversation channel,
  including agents and headless participants, with top-level `type`, `name`,
  `isPerson`, `isAgent`, and optional `handle`. `headless`/`panel` clients are
  neither people nor agents. It is available only in channel-bound agent eval.
- `services.gad.inspectChannelRoster(...)` — durable channel diagnostic
  evidence; it is not workspace-wide presence.

```ts
eval({
  code: `
    const [profile, members, present, channelParticipants] = await Promise.all([
      services.account.getProfile(),
      services.account.listWorkspaceMembers(),
      services.workspacePresence.list(),
      chat.getParticipants(),
    ]);
    return { profile, members, present, channelParticipants };
  `,
});
```

Server-wide multi-workspace catalog operations belong to the shell or CLI's
stable hub session and are intentionally unavailable from workspace eval.
Current-workspace APIs remain available. Do not guess a hub session id or retry
an unavailable `hubControl` service from agent eval.

## Credential Lookups

Use the operation that answers the user's question directly. To call an
external API, import `credentials` from `@workspace/runtime` and call
`credentials.fetch(...)` once. Do not preflight it with
`resolveCredential(...)`: the fetch already returns the canonical
missing-credential outcome without exposing credential material.

Use `resolveCredential(...)` only when the task is explicitly to diagnose
credential routing without making a network request. A quiet URL lookup is one
read-only call and returns a secret-free summary or `null`:

```ts
import { credentials } from "@workspace/runtime";

const credential = await credentials.resolveCredential({ url });
return { hasCredential: credential !== null };
```

Do not list every credential before resolving one URL. For a bounded lifecycle
inventory, use the aggregate API directly:

```ts
return credentials.summarizeStoredCredentials();
```

Use `credentials.inspectStoredCredentials()` only when an administrator
actually needs per-credential runtime/grant details; it may require
`credentials.audit.read` authority. In general, omit `authority.requests` to
use the caller's admitted authority; when an exact
allowlist is genuinely required, discover its exact capability/resource first.
Never invent a wildcard such as `workspace:*`.

## Path Conventions

- `eval`, `inline_ui`, `load_action_bar`, and `feedback_custom` `path`
  parameters are context-relative file paths such as `.vibestudio/eval/audit.ts`;
  do not prefix these with `/`.
- Runtime `fs.*` methods are rooted at the caller's current context folder. A
  leading slash in `fs.readFile("/panels/chat/package.json")` means
  "context-root absolute", not a host path like `/home/...`. Prefer
  `panels/chat/package.json` in examples and source edits because it is less
  ambiguous.
- Workspace source paths have repo shape (`packages/<name>/…`,
  `panels/<name>/…`, `meta/…`, etc.) and mutating them through `fs` is captured
  by the semantic adapter against the exact working head. Managed
  move/copy retains identity/provenance. Platform-ignored paths and paths outside
  workspace source repos are direct context-local scratch. For disposable files, prefer
  `const path = await fs.mktemp("purpose")`; for a directory use
  `const dir = await fs.mkdtemp("purpose")`. See
  [EVAL.md](EVAL.md#filesystem-access) for copy/rename and cleanup examples.
- Never use host absolute paths for workspace source such as
  `/home/user/.../workspace/panels/...`.

## Available Imports

### In `eval` (server-side)

The injected variables above (`rpc`, `services`, `fs`, `ctx`, `scope`, `scopes`,
`db`, `help`) are NOT imports — use them as free variables. Everything else is
loaded via the `imports` parameter (npm) or auto-resolution (workspace), then
brought in with a normal `import`. Both static `import` and dynamic
`await import(...)` work in eval — both compile to the EvalDO's per-object
require (isolated per owner). See [EVAL.md](EVAL.md#imports).

### In components (`inline_ui` / `load_action_bar` / `feedback_custom`)

These are pre-bundled with the panel and work as bare `import` statements in
component code:

| Module                                  | What it provides                                                                    |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@workspace/runtime`                    | rpc, fs, git, workers, workspace, contextId, panel navigation, credentials, and GAD |
| `browserData` from `@workspace/runtime` | Browser data import/export (cookies, passwords, bookmarks, history)                 |
| `react`, `react/jsx-runtime`            | React hooks and component APIs                                                      |
| `@radix-ui/themes`                      | UI components (Button, Flex, Card, Table, etc.)                                     |
| `@radix-ui/react-icons`                 | Icon components                                                                     |

### On-demand imports (require `imports` parameter)

For browser automation, use `handle.cdp.page()` — it returns the canonical
Playwright-style page driven by our workerd-native CDP client
and is the single browser-automation surface (there is no separate "full
Playwright" tier; do not import or install any `playwright*` package). It loads
the standalone `@workspace/cdp-client` internally, so eval code should not import
that package directly for ordinary page work. For protocol-level CDP, you may
`import { CdpConnection } from "@workspace/cdp-client"` and connect via
`handle.cdp.getCdpEndpoint()`. See [BROWSER_AUTOMATION.md](BROWSER_AUTOMATION.md).

These are built on first use. Pass them in the tool's `imports` parameter:

| Module                                  | `imports` value                         | What it provides                      |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `@workspace-skills/*`                   | auto-resolved                           | Just `import` — built on first use    |
| `@workspace/*` packages                 | auto-resolved                           | Just `import` — built on first use    |
| platform SDK packages (`@vibestudio/*`) | auto-resolved                           | Just `import` — built on first use    |
| npm packages                            | `imports: { "lodash": "npm:^4.17.21" }` | Requires explicit `imports` parameter |

Workspace packages (`@workspace*`) and platform SDK packages
(`@vibestudio/*`) are **auto-resolved** — just write the import statement and
they are built on demand. No `imports` parameter is needed.

npm packages require the `imports` parameter with `"npm:<version>"` for raw inline code, using registry semver/range values such as `"npm:1"`, `"npm:1.3.0"`, or `"npm:^4.17.21"`. File-loaded code can infer dependency versions from the nearest `package.json`.

File-loaded package inference checks `dependencies`, `peerDependencies`,
`optionalDependencies`, then `devDependencies`. It also supports
`package.json` `imports` aliases and simple `tsconfig.json` paths. Use explicit
`imports` to override inferred versions.

To evaluate a workspace package from a non-default revision, pass an explicit
build selector accepted by the live import resolver. Semantic VCS selectors and
content-only build selectors have different authority; read
[vibestudio-vcs](../vibestudio-vcs/SKILL.md) before carrying an identity from a
build into a source operation.

In eval, injected ambient globals like `services`, `ctx`, `scope`, `scopes`,
`db`, `chat`, `agent`, and `help` are free variables, not runtime exports. For
portable client code, `@workspace/runtime` is importable in eval and exports
namespaces such as `vcs`, `fs`, `workspace`, `credentials`, and `panelTree`:

```
eval({ code: `
  import { contextId, vcs } from "@workspace/runtime";
  import { createProjects } from "@workspace-skills/workspace-dev";
  const status = await vcs.status({ contextId });
  // workspace packages: just import, auto-resolved
` })
```

For direct authoring, use the schema-validated
[VCS authoring examples](../vibestudio-vcs/references/authoring-basics.md).
Take `contextId` from the runtime binding, select a repository returned at the
exact working head by the task-supplied path, and use complete file
identities returned by `vcs.inspect`/`vcs.neighbors` and `vcs.listFiles`. Never assume `default` or
`projects/default`.

The runtime `vcs` namespace is generated from one canonical method registry.
Use `await help("vcs")` for transport shapes and the
[Vibestudio VCS skill](../vibestudio-vcs/SKILL.md) for semantics. The unit of
revision is an event or application state, not a per-repository state hash.

See [EVAL.md](EVAL.md) for details. On-demand imports are not available in inline_ui/load_action_bar/feedback_custom components (use eval to preload first).

## Interaction Patterns

See [MDX.md](MDX.md) for rich normal chat messages and `ActionButton`.
See [INTERACTION_PATTERNS.md](INTERACTION_PATTERNS.md) for when to use inline UI vs eval for side-effect actions. In short: if an action involves choices or could fail, prefer rendering an inline UI that lets the user trigger it. When a UI control represents a user choice or follow-up instruction that should go back to the agent, send that prompt with `chat.send(content)`. Use [ACTION_BAR.md](ACTION_BAR.md) when small controls or status should stay pinned above chat history for the current panel. For setup workflows with links, use the [INLINE_UI.md](INLINE_UI.md) link/checklist patterns and offer both internal browser-panel opens and approval-gated `openExternal` system-browser opens.

Transcript-visible behavior is driven by typed PubSub events. User-authored
prompts generated by inline UI, action bars, or similar controls should go
through `chat.send(content)`, which publishes a canonical `message.completed`
agentic event and can start the next agent turn. Do not use `chat.send` for
agent acknowledgements or ordinary eval status; those should come from the
agent's normal response path. Do **not** use `chat.publish("message", {
content })` for visible transcript text: that writes a legacy raw PubSub row
which may be persisted but is not reduced by the current `agentic-chat` UI.
Rendered UI should go through `inline_ui`, `load_action_bar`, `feedback_form`,
or `feedback_custom` rather than hand-written raw channel records.

## Critical Rules

1. **Do NOT import eval-only ambient variables** — `ctx`, `scope`, `scopes`, `db`, `help`, `chat`, and `agent` are injected free variables in eval. `services`, `hosts`, `runtime`, `rpc`, and `fs` are portable bindings shared with panels/workers, so either use them directly in eval or import them from `@workspace/runtime`. For _packages_, both static `import` and dynamic `await import(...)` work in eval. File-loaded relative imports must be static/literal.
2. **Workspace packages are auto-resolved** — just write `import { createProjects } from "@workspace-skills/workspace-dev"` and it builds on first use; npm packages require `imports: { "lodash": "npm:^4.17.21" }`. (For raw services, use `rpc.call("main", "<svc>.<method>", [...])`.)
3. **Components must `export default`** — named exports alone won't work for inline_ui/load_action_bar/feedback_custom components
4. **Inline UI / action-bar components receive `{ props, chat }`** (NOT `scope`/`scopes` — the eval REPL scope is server-side and is not shared into rendered components) — always default `props` (`{ props = {}, chat }`) and guard property access (`props?.items ?? []`). For maximum portability, prefer embedding small constant data in the component source.
5. **Feedback components receive `{ onSubmit, onCancel, onError, chat }`**
6. **Workspace code builds from the exact working head** — source under `packages/`, `panels/`, `workers/`, `skills/`, `apps/`, and `extensions/` is one semantic workspace. Managed edits author work units and advance the working head; commit records the complete local application chain. Run explicit context checks for advisory confidence. Protected publication validates semantic ancestry and integration, obtains approval, and atomically advances refs; post-publication builds are derived projections, and runtime activation retains the previous runnable artifact on failure. Read [vibestudio-vcs](../vibestudio-vcs/SKILL.md) before any source operation.
7. **Close temporary panels you open** — when eval opens a browser/workspace panel for diagnostics, scraping, setup, or testing, keep its handle and call `await handle.close()` in `finally` when done. Reuse an existing handle instead of opening duplicates. Leave a panel open only when the user explicitly asked to inspect or continue using it, or the workflow explicitly needs it to remain open.
8. **Use DO workers for shared app data** — eval `db` is private scratch storage for the current EvalDO. User-facing databases should be Durable Object services with narrow RPC methods, live service `authority.principals`, and method-level `@rpc({ principals, effect, tier, sensitivity })`.

For optional workspace probes, prefer one of these patterns:

- Import the helper statically and catch the helper call:
  `const status = await getStatus().catch(error => ({ error: String(error) }))`.
- If the helper may not exist in this workspace at all, run that probe in a
  separate eval and tolerate that separate eval failing.

(A missing package still throws even though dynamic `await import(...)` works in
eval, so wrap optional loads in a try/catch or isolate them in a separate eval.)

## Environment Compatibility

- `inline_ui`, `load_action_bar`, `feedback_form`, and `feedback_custom` are **panel-only** — they render in a browser context, so they require a connected panel.
- `eval` runs **server-side** in your per-agent `EvalDO`: it works in both panel and **headless** sessions and keeps working even if the panel or user disconnects. `set_title` works in both panel and headless sessions.
