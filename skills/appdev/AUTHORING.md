# App Authoring

Trusted workspace apps live under `apps/` and use flat source paths:

| Package name                 | Source path       |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `@workspace-apps/shell`      | `apps/shell`      |
| `@workspace-apps/mobile`     | `apps/mobile`     |
| `@workspace-apps/remote-cli` | `apps/remote-cli` |
| `@workspace-apps/foo`        | `apps/foo`        |

Do not add a package scope segment to the filesystem path. The path
`apps/@workspace-apps/foo` is wrong.

## Package Manifest

Each app is a normal package with a `vibestudio.app` manifest in `package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "@workspace-apps/foo",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "type": "module",
  "vibestudio": {
    "displayName": "Foo",
    "app": {
      "target": "electron",
      "renderer": "index.tsx",
      "capabilities": ["notifications"]
    }
  }
}
```

Fields:

- `name`: stable app principal identity. Must use `@workspace-apps/<name>`.
- `vibestudio.displayName`: user-facing name in approval and unit surfaces.
- `vibestudio.app.target`: one of `electron`, `react-native`, or `terminal`.
- Target entry:
  - `electron`: `renderer`
  - `react-native`: `renderer`, plus mobile metadata such as
    `rnComponentName` and `rnHostAbi`
  - `terminal`: `entry`
- `vibestudio.app.capabilities`: explicit host/service privileges.

## Workspace Declaration

Apps are trusted workspace units and should be declared in `meta/vibestudio.yml`
when they are part of the workspace runtime:

```yaml
apps:
  - source: apps/shell
    ref: main
```

Declaration fields:

- `source`: repo path such as `apps/shell`, or the app package name when
  supported by the resolver.
- `ref`: git ref to build. Defaults to `main` when omitted.

Changing declared apps, source, ref, dependency EVs, external dependencies,
capabilities, provider identity, or active build identity can re-gate approval.

## Build Identity

App builds are content-addressed and approved as trusted units. The build
identity includes:

- unit kind and package name
- source repo and ref
- effective version of the app
- transitive dependency effective versions
- external dependency versions
- app capabilities
- target/provider metadata where applicable

This means adding a capability, changing a dependency, changing the React Native
provider, or pushing new app source can require a new approval before the app is
active.

## Runtime Update Protocol

Apps should subscribe to `apps:lifecycle` when they need to show update state in
their own UI. Relevant event types are:

- `update-available`: a new trusted build is active on the server and can be
  loaded by clients. Payload includes app id, source, target, build key,
  effective version, previous build metadata, `canRollback`, and an
  `adoptionPolicy`.
- `update-error`: source was published, but its derived build or activation
  failed. The previous active build remains selected. Payload includes the
  error and rollback availability.
- `rolled-back`: the server switched the app back to a previous trusted build.

Adoption policies are target-aware. `prompt` means the client should keep its
currently loaded build and ask the user when to adopt the new one. `immediate`
is used for first load, user-requested rollback, and terminal process
replacement. Terminal apps are supervised by the server runner once started.

For explicit version controls, call
`runtime.supervision.versions({ kind: "app", releaseId: appName })` to list
current/previous app builds and
`runtime.supervision.rollback({ kind: "app", releaseId: appName }, { buildKey? })`
to restore one. Shell can manage all app releases; ordinary app callers can
manage their own app release.

Host notifications can include typed app commands:

- `{ type: "app.applyUpdate", appId }`
- `{ type: "runtime.supervision.rollback", release: { kind: "app", releaseId: appId }, buildKey? }`
- `{ type: "runtime.supervision.restart", identity: { kind: "app", entityId } }`

Prefer these structured commands over encoding app ids in action strings.
Desktop shell also exposes a durable App updates section in connection settings
for pending updates, retained rollback versions, and recent app update errors.

## App Data And Worker Services

Apps are trusted client runtimes, not database hosts. When an app needs durable
workspace data, build a worker Durable Object service and let that DO own SQLite
through `this.sql`. The app resolves the service through the runtime and calls
narrow RPC methods:

```ts
import { rpc, workers } from "@workspace/runtime";

const store = await workers.resolveService("example.todos.v1", "project-123");
if (store.kind !== "durable-object") throw new Error("Expected DO service");

await rpc.call(store.targetId, "upsertTodo", [{ title: "Review mobile pairing" }]);
const todos = await rpc.call(store.targetId, "listTodos", []);
```

The service declaration in `meta/vibestudio.yml` must admit app callers:

```yaml
services:
  - source: workers/todo-store
    name: todo-store
    protocols: [example.todos.v1]
    authority:
      principals: [user, code]
    durableObject:
      className: TodoStore
```

The DO methods must also admit app callers:

```ts
@rpc({
  principals: ["user", "code"],
  effect: { kind: "open" },
  tier: "open",
  sensitivity: "read",
})
listTodos() { ... }
```

Use a singleton object for one workspace-wide database, or pass an explicit
`objectKey` to `workers.resolveService(protocol, objectKey)` for per-project,
per-account, or per-document databases. Do not expose raw SQL to app renderers;
expose app-shaped methods and validate inputs in the DO.

For the full pattern, including schema migrations and tests, read
[`../workspace-dev/WORKERS.md`](../workspace-dev/WORKERS.md#durable-object-backed-app-databases).

## Source And Imports

Use workspace dependencies for shared code:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@workspace/react": "workspace:*",
    "@vibestudio/rpc": "workspace:*",
    "@vibestudio/shared": "workspace:*"
  }
}
```

Guidelines:

- Keep app-only UI in `apps/<name>`.
- Put reusable cross-target logic in `packages/`.
- Keep native host code outside `workspace/apps/mobile`; the workspace mobile
  app should consume native host APIs through its service wrappers.
- Do not import server/main internals from workspace app code.
- Treat app source as part of the workspace semantic graph. Read
  [vibestudio-vcs](../vibestudio-vcs/SKILL.md), author against an exact working
  head, build or test that state, commit the complete local application chain,
  and publish only after semantic ancestry/integration validation and approval.
  Builds and tests are explicit local feedback checks; protected publication
  repeats the exact-candidate build/typecheck gate, while post-publication
  builds are derived projections. Managed move/copy operations preserve file identity
  and provenance; raw filesystem mutation is not an alternate source-authority
  path.

## Choosing Apps vs Panels vs Extensions

Use an app when the code is a trusted client runtime:

- the desktop shell UI
- the mobile workspace shell loaded by a native host
- a future terminal client
- a client that owns pairing or principal-grant flows

Use a panel when the code is an ordinary workspace surface shown inside the
shell. Use an extension when the code needs trusted Node/server-side access or
long-lived service behavior. Use a worker/DO when an isolate service is enough.

## Panel Links

Do not treat a panel's loopback HTTP asset URL as its durable address. Use
`buildPanelLink()` for an in-app link, `buildPanelDeepLink()` for an installed
app link, or `buildPanelShareLink()` for an HTTPS App/Universal Link. All three
preserve `ref`, `contextId`, `stateArgs`, `name`, `focus`, and placement
(`current`, `child`, or `root`). See
[`../../../docs/panel-locations.md`](../../../docs/panel-locations.md) for the
contract and security constraints.
