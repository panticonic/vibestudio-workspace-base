# Automations API

Resolve protocol `vibestudio.missions.v1` with `workers.resolveService(...)`,
then call the returned Durable Object target with `rpc.call(targetId, method,
args)`. The service is context-aware and user-scoped.

Agent-authored definitions use the higher-level ambient
`automations.propose(input)` binding. It calls `proposeDraft` with a transport
idempotency key and, before returning, publishes one typed
`automation.instituted` event as the owning agent in the current channel. This
is the documented proposal path because it supplies trusted channel provenance
without putting channel identifiers in the mission API. Direct service calls
remain the lower-level lifecycle contract for non-chat integrations.

This service owns the complete automation lifecycle: definition and human
review, schedule delivery, non-overlapping execution, durable run history,
terminal summaries and errors, and agent-conversation identity. Callers must
not create a second timer, queue, conversation loop, or run ledger around it.

## Charter

```ts
type Charter = {
  summary: string;
  harness: { unit: string; ev: string }; // exact 64-hex EV
  execution:
    | {
        kind: "method";
        target: { source: string; className: string; objectKey: string };
        method: string;
        args: unknown[];
      }
    | {
        kind: "agent";
        target: { source: string; className: string; objectKey: string };
        action:
          | { kind: "prompt"; text: string }
          | {
              kind: "eval";
              code: string;
              syntax?: "javascript" | "typescript" | "jsx" | "tsx";
              timeoutMs?: number;
              reset?: boolean;
            };
        conversation:
          | { mode: "fresh" }
          | { mode: "continue"; channelId: string; contextId: string };
        toolExposure: {
          services: string[];
          userlandServices: Array<{
            name: string;
            provider: string;
            providerEv: string;
            upgradePolicy: "pinned" | "follow-head";
          }>;
          workspaceServiceDiscovery: "bound" | "live-declarations";
          evalNetwork: "none" | "declared-origins" | "unrestricted";
          declaredOrigins: string[];
        };
        declaredLineageClasses: Array<"none" | "web" | "email" | "channel-external" | "external">;
      };
  trigger:
    | { kind: "manual" }
    | {
        kind: "schedule";
        everyMs: number;
        anchorAt?: number;
        jitterMs?: number;
        untilAt?: number;
        maxRuns?: number;
      }
    | {
        kind: "cron";
        expression: string; // five-field Vixie cron
        timezone: string; // canonical IANA timezone
        untilAt?: number;
        maxRuns?: number;
      };
};
```

The harness unit must equal the execution target source. Every behavior-bearing
field participates in the reviewed closure digest. `agent/eval` stores exact
inline EvalDO source in that closure and is the happy path for a small script
that should run as an existing agent/channel participant. It deliberately does
not accept a mutable context-file path or npm import map. Use ambient runtime
bindings and automatically resolved workspace APIs; move a multi-file or
dependency-heavy job into a reviewed method worker.

The eval action is model-free. AgentDO journals `message.completed` with the
tool call, `invocation.started`, the terminal eval result, and `turn.closed` in
the ordinary channel trajectory. EvalDO receives `approvals:
"pregranted-only"`; the run cannot stall on an unattended approval card. Code
may use ambient `chat` to publish typed/custom messages with the agent's
identity. The mission service remains the only schedule and run-ledger owner.

Interval schedules are elapsed-time cadences with an optional alignment anchor
and jitter. Cron schedules are wall-clock cadences evaluated in the reviewed
IANA timezone, including daylight-saving transitions. Both accept `untilAt`
(no new run starts at or after the boundary) and `maxRuns` (total admitted runs;
failures count and overlap skips do not). The count survives revisions.

The shared chat-history inspector and Automations dashboard render calendar
schedules in plain language. Their editor round-trips common hourly, daily,
weekly, and monthly expressions through visual controls and preserves all other
valid expressions in an Advanced editor with validation and upcoming-run
previews. Both paths save the same canonical `cron` trigger.

A prompt tick can end its recurring goal by calling
`complete_automation({ response })`. Eval and method executions return the same
signal as data:

```ts
return {
  protocol: "automation-completion.v1",
  response: "All rollout targets are healthy; monitoring is complete.",
};
```

Ordinary successful results continue the schedule. The explicit completion
response transitions the definition to `completed`, is retained on the run and
definition, and wins over a count/time boundary reached on that same run.

`overview` defaults to 30 definitions and accepts at most 50. Its `stats`
contains global `total`, `active`, `running`, `failedLast24Hours`, and
`awaitingReview`, and `completed` counts regardless of the page or filter.
Filters are `all`, `attention`, `active`, `paused`, `completed`, and `drafts`;
`query` searches names and
summaries on the server. Pass its exact `nextCursor` to fetch another page.

`listRuns` defaults to 20 and accepts at most 100. Pass the exact
`nextCursor` returned by the preceding page.

Ordinary agent sessions can discover and call `edit`, `runNow`, `pause`,
`resume`, and `retire` through the live service catalog, subject to their normal
gated/critical authority. `requestReview` is intentionally not agent-facing;
only a human review surface may activate a draft or edited revision.

## Run record

```ts
type Run = {
  runId: string;
  missionId: string;
  closureDigest: string;
  revision: number;
  trigger: "manual" | "scheduled";
  status: "starting" | "running" | "succeeded" | "failed" | "skipped";
  startedAt: number;
  runNumber?: number; // absent only for visible overlap skips and old history
  finishedAt?: number;
  channelId?: string;
  contextId?: string;
  finalMessage?: string;
  completionResponse?: string;
  error?: string;
};
```

Agent runs close from the exact terminal turn. Method runs close after their RPC
returns or throws. Stored final messages and errors are bounded; full agent
detail remains in the linked conversation. `channelId` and `contextId` are the
canonical deep-link identity for that conversation; do not derive a link from
names or run order.

Mission records also include lifetime `runCount`, `activatedAt` after first
human activation, and—when naturally ended—`completedAt`, `completionReason`
(`until`, `max-runs`, or `response`), and optional `completionResponse`. Chat
turn metadata carries a bounded immutable tick snapshot—mission/run ids, run
number, name, revision, action, trigger, schedule, creation/activation times—so
collapsed history pills render without network reads. Opening a pill lazily
calls `get` and `getRun` for current controls and full bounded details.

Agent proposal also writes a bounded immutable definition snapshot—mission id,
name, summary, revision, action, schedule, and creation time—to the originating
channel. Its institution pill therefore renders immediately and performs no
service read while collapsed. Opening it calls only `get`; no run exists yet.
The same shared inspector provides editing and human review controls, and later
provides run-now, pause/stop, resume, completion, and historical tick details as
the definition changes state.
