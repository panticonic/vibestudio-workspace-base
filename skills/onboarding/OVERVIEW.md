Vibestudio is a desktop application (Electron) that gives you a personal, AI-powered workspace organized as horizontally stacked panels. Each panel is its own TypeScript app running in an isolated webview, and an AI agent (the chat panel) can create, edit, and launch new panels on the fly.

## Key Concepts

### Panels

Panels are the building blocks of your workspace. Each panel is a self-contained TypeScript/React app that gets bundled by esbuild and served in its own webview. Panels can:

- Access a sandboxed filesystem, AI models, and DO-backed app databases
- Open browser panels to view and automate websites
- Communicate with other panels via RPC
- Launch child panels

The **chat panel** is the default root panel — it's where you interact with the AI agent.

### Trusted Apps

Trusted workspace apps live under `apps/` and use package names such as
`@workspace-apps/shell`, `@workspace-apps/mobile`, and
`@workspace-apps/remote-cli`. Apps are for trusted client runtimes, not ordinary
panels. Use the `appdev` skill before creating or changing apps.

### Workspaces

A workspace is a named collection of panels, packages, workers, and configuration. You can:

- Create multiple workspaces (e.g. "personal", "work", "experiment")
- Fork a workspace to branch off a snapshot
- Switch between workspaces (triggers app relaunch)
- Configure which panels open on first launch (`initPanels`)

Workspace config lives in `meta/vibestudio.yml`. Each workspace gets one
semantic provenance/VCS graph with a committed event and exact working head.

### Contexts

A context is an isolated execution environment for a panel. Each context gets:

- Its own **context folder** — a materialized view of the workspace state
- A unique **context ID** used in URLs and storage

Panels in the same context share a filesystem. The chat panel's agent and its child panels typically share a context so they can see each other's files.

### The Agent (Chat Panel)

The chat panel hosts an AI agent that can:

- **Run code** via the `eval` tool — runs server-side in the agent's own notebook
  kernel (activation-resident live objects plus durable exact recovery; works even
  if the panel is closed)
- **Render UI** via `inline_ui` (persistent components and self-contained
  workflows in chat), `load_action_bar` / panel `actionBarFile` (compact pinned
  panel controls), and `feedback_custom` only when the agent needs ordinary
  structured input for reasoning—never for trust, permission, publication, or
  workspace-settings decisions owned by host approvals
- **Preserve transcript state** through typed PubSub events: messages,
  invocations, inline UI, and action bars all replay from the same channel log
- **Read/write files** in the workspace
- **Build and launch panels** on demand
- **Connect API provider integrations** — Gmail, GitHub, Slack, and other OAuth/credential-backed services
- **Tune its own model defaults** — the host chat agent's provider, effort, approval, and chattiness are configurable
- **Import browser data** — cookies, passwords, bookmarks, history
- **Automate browsers** via Playwright-style CDP automation (`handle.cdp.page()`)
- **Schedule recurring work** — run a reviewed worker method, exact inline eval,
  or agent prompt on an interval or timezone-aware cron calendar, optionally
  ending at a time, run limit, or natural completion response; inspect and
  control every durable tick from its chat-history pill or Automations
- **Use private eval SQLite for scratch work**, call DO-backed app databases,
  call AI models, manage workers

### Automations

Automations are reviewed recurring tasks. A reusable deterministic job runs as
a method on an exact Durable Object build. A smaller exact script can run inline
in an existing agent's channel-bound EvalDO without publishing a new worker;
agent work can instead send a prompt through the ordinary turn loop. Both agent
actions use either a fresh conversation for every run or one specific
continuing conversation. Agents can prepare and edit inert drafts and control
reviewed runs, but only the user activates a revision after reviewing the exact
target, schedule, end policy, reach, and standing authority. Schedules can use
elapsed intervals or five-field cron in a reviewed IANA timezone. They can end
at a time, after a maximum number of admitted runs, or when a prompt, eval, or
method returns an explicit natural-completion response.

The **Automations** panel is both the review and supervision surface. It
highlights active runs, completed definitions, drafts awaiting review, and
recent failures; provides search, filters, and paged run history; shows each
run's completion response, final message, or error; and links agent runs to
their exact conversations. The same definition/tick inspector appears on
first-class scheduled-activity pills in chat history, with lazy detail loading
plus edit and stop/resume controls.

### Workers (Workerd)

Workers are Cloudflare V8 isolates (via workerd) that run server-side logic. They support **Durable Objects** for persistent, stateful services. The agent system itself runs on workers with DOs for conversation channels and agent state.

Durable Objects are the normal application database primitive: each DO instance
owns SQLite through `this.sql`, and panels/apps/agents call its declared service
methods through `workers.resolveService(...)` and `rpc.call(...)`. The eval
`db` is private scratch storage for the agent's EvalDO, not a shared app
database.

### Runtime APIs

All panels and sandbox code can import from `@workspace/runtime`:

| API         | What it provides                                     |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `fs`        | Filesystem scoped to the context folder              |
| `ai`        | Text generation and streaming (multiple model roles) |
| `workers`   | Resolve worker/DO services, including app databases  |
| `workspace` | List, create, configure, switch workspaces           |
| `rpc`       | Call services on the main process or other panels    |

Additional surfaces: `browserData` from `@workspace/runtime` (browser data import/export), and `@workspace/cdp-client` (the workerd-native CDP client used by `handle.cdp.page()` — the single Playwright-style browser-automation surface; reach it through the handle, and use its exported `CdpConnection` only for protocol-level work).

### Build System

Panels and workers are built **on demand** — when you navigate to a panel URL or
create a worker instance, the build system compiles an explicit semantic or
content build source with esbuild. A protected publication validates the
affected build units and their transitive reverse dependents before advancing
main; later build/activation work remains a derived projection of that exact
published state.

- **Panels** connect to the server over WebSocket for RPC
- The **server** handles builds, file access, VCS, external Git interop, database, AI proxy, and service routing
- **Workerd** runs workers and Durable Objects in V8 isolates
- The **semantic VCS graph** unifies source intent, applications, decisions,
  ancestry, provenance, and exact content projections
