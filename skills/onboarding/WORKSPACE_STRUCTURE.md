# Workspace Directory Structure

A Vibestudio workspace is organized into source directories backed by one
semantic provenance/VCS graph. Isolated context folders materialize exact state
nodes without creating parallel histories.

## The meta/ Directory

`meta/` contains workspace-level configuration that agents need access to:

- **vibestudio.yml** — Workspace configuration (initial panels and external git remotes). Read by the server at startup; agents can read it via `workspace.getConfig()`.
- **AGENTS.md** — The system prompt injected into every agent session. Loaded by the resource loader at agent startup. Agents can also read it directly from `meta/AGENTS.md` in their context folder.

Workspace-wide onboarding lives in `skills/onboarding/` because it describes the
whole workspace rather than the `meta/` config repo itself.

Like every other source directory, `meta/` participates in the workspace-wide
semantic VCS. This means:

- It is readable from any context (materialized into the context folder on demand)
- Agents can author local applications and commit their complete context chain
- Publishing the committed workspace event triggers affected rebuilds and
  config reloads
- External Git checkouts live operationally below `state/git-checkouts/`, never
  in workspace source. External repository imports use one explicit userland
  `git.importProject()` call and return
  unpublished candidates. Prefer `git.setSharedRemote(path, remote)` for
  targeted approval instead of editing an operational checkout by hand. See
  [EXTERNAL_GIT_PROJECTS.md](EXTERNAL_GIT_PROJECTS.md) for config shape,
  approvals, branch/default discovery, logical credentials, atomic import
  evidence, and nonmutating previews.

## Context Folders

When a panel or agent session starts, it gets a **context folder** — an isolated
materialization of one context's working state. Each context has one committed
event and an exact event/application working head. The disk tree is a
disposable projection; semantic history lives only in the context graph.

Managed edits author changes and append local applications. Comparison and
merge accounts for incoming work in bounded stable-coordinate pages; commit
consumes the complete local chain. Run explicit checks against the context for
advisory confidence. Protected publication validates semantic ancestry and
integration, obtains approval, and atomically advances `main`; builds react as
separate projections. Read
[vibestudio-vcs](../vibestudio-vcs/SKILL.md) before operating on source.

Use `ref: "ctx:<contextId>"` only when intentionally building/testing code from
that moving context selector. `contextId` alone selects runtime state/files, not
code provenance. Content-only build selectors are valid for rendering and
builds but cannot be used as semantic ancestry or mutation authority.

## Trusted Apps And Extensions

Apps and extensions use flat source paths. A package named
`@workspace-apps/foo` lives at `apps/foo`; a package named
`@workspace-extensions/bar` lives at `extensions/bar`. Do not add package
scope segments to the filesystem path.

Workspace app targets are:

- `electron` — browser/Electron shell surfaces.
- `react-native` — mobile workspace app bundles.
- `terminal` — supervised Node CLI/client processes for terminal-client style
  tooling.

Capabilities are explicit in `package.json`. User and device invitations are
account operations on the typed `hubControl` service, not app capabilities.

For the full trust and client-auth model, see
`docs/trusted-workspace-units.md` in the Vibestudio source checkout.

For authoring apps, target contracts, capabilities, mobile bootstrap, and
terminal-client guidance, read `skills/appdev/SKILL.md`.

## Plain Projects

`projects/` is for repositories that should be editable in the workspace but
are not themselves panels, workers, skills, templates, or packages consumed by
the workspace build system. Examples include upstream application checkouts,
third-party libraries, or larger patch branches an agent is preparing.

Plain projects are still external Git-backed projects when imported that way:

- They appear as shared semantic workspace source only after the exact import
  candidate is integrated, committed, and published. A host clone by itself is
  an interchange artifact, not a workspace-state transition.
- Once published, they are readable from contexts through the ordinary semantic
  state/materialization path.
- Shared remotes declared under `git.remotes.projects.<repo>.<remoteName>` are
  configured in the operational checkout under `state/git-checkouts/`. Use
  object declarations with `url` and `branch` when a workspace project must
  clone a non-default branch.
- `git.importProject({ path: "projects/name", remote })` coordinates remote
  configuration/clone and crosses into the semantic graph through one explicit
  `vcs.importSnapshot` work unit. It returns a committed candidate context and
  event without advancing protected `main`, plus required semantic evidence
  from that same atomic import transaction. Later pulls use the same exact
  snapshot import for that stable repository identity; each import authors
  ordinary changes and follows the same coordinate merge path.
- An explicit userland `git.importProject()` creates one unpublished candidate
  per external source and never advances protected main by importing alone.
- Build V2 reads the published or candidate semantic state through the CAS. It
  never builds from the operational Git checkout.
- They are not launchable runtime units and do not become `@workspace/*`
  packages.

For branch-aware declarations, import approvals, startup auto-import, and
credentialed private repo retries, see
[EXTERNAL_GIT_PROJECTS.md](EXTERNAL_GIT_PROJECTS.md).

## Base template vs live workspace

A live workspace is created from the promoted base template's exact Git pin;
the Vibestudio host does not contain a fallback copy of workspace source.

1. The host acquires and verifies the configured base URL, ref, commit, and
   snapshot.
2. It imports those repositories through exact `vcs.importSnapshot` work units
   with explicit repository and file identities.
3. It builds and activates the base manifest, including the manifest-declared
   `gad.workspace` source provider.
4. The template composer adopts the byte-identical base on first run and
   publishes the composition lock. Optional templates then use the same
   inspect, build, approval, and protected-publication path.

A fresh development or system-test instance performs this same base acquisition
and bootstrap. Editing a live workspace changes that workspace's semantic
source; publishing or suggesting those changes is explicit and never mirrors
them into a host checkout.
