/**
 * One pane: a native-view content state machine with only a six-pixel shell
 * rail above it. The rail preserves an unobscured tree-drop target (D9)
 * without duplicating the titlebar for every vertically stacked pane. Actions
 * for the focused pane live in the global titlebar, outside native-view bounds.
 *
 * The rail also has to carry focus. A pane's outline is drawn on shell DOM, but
 * the native view composites above it and sits flush to the left, right and
 * bottom edges, so only the top strip is ever actually visible — which is why
 * this doubles as the focus indicator. It says so in neutral greys rather than
 * a brand wash: a saturated slab across the top of every pane fights whatever
 * page is rendering below it. The accent is spent only while a drag is over the
 * rail, where it has to read instantly.
 *
 * Only the drop target needs the full six pixels; the *mark* does not. Painting
 * the whole strip made every pane look capped by a stray scrollbar, so the rail
 * itself stays transparent and a short centred grip carries the state instead —
 * grown and darkened when focused, the way a handle is meant to read. Drag-over
 * is the one case that still washes the entire strip, because at that moment
 * the question being answered is "how big is the target", not "which pane".
