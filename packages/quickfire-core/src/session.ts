/**
 * The transport-agnostic core of one quickfire conversation
 * (quickfire-overlay-spec §2.4).
 *
 * The desktop overlay and the mobile sheet resolve, join, reduce and drive the
 * same durable conversation; only the way they reach the workspace differs
 * (Electron's preload RPC bridge vs. the mobile WebRTC pipe). So the whole
 * lifecycle lives here and each client injects a `QuickfireTransport`.
 *
 * Three deliberate choices, unchanged from the desktop original:
 *
 *  - `sessionFor` runs on the user gesture that enters quickfire mode, never on
 *    hover or focus change. Binding a slot creates an agent; that must be
 *    something the user did.
 *  - Only the last `TRANSCRIPT_LIMIT` entries are projected at a time, over a
 *    deliberately wider `REPLAY_LIMIT` join. `showOlder` first widens that
 *    local window, then pages backward through the durable channel when the
 *    buffered replay is exhausted.
 *  - Reduction is throttled to ~30 Hz. A streaming turn emits far more events
 *    than either client can usefully repaint.
