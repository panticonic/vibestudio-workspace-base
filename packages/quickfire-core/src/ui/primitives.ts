/**
 * The primitive contract the shared overlay components draw against.
 *
 * `apps/shell/SKILL.md` says desktop and mobile share presentation *rules*, not
 * renderer components — and that rule produced two hand-written transcripts that
 * drifted apart in every detail that mattered (one showed a tool's failure text,
 * the other did not; one glued a notice's detail into its heading; both wrote
 * their own Markdown walker, their own relative-time function and their own
 * disclosure behaviour).
 *
 * This is the narrow waist that lets the *components* be shared too without
 * pretending a WebContentsView and a React Native sheet are the same runtime:
 * the shared tree never names a `div`, a `View`, a colour or a font. It composes
 * a handful of semantic primitives, and each client supplies them in its own
 * idiom — CSS classes over DOM nodes on desktop, StyleSheet objects over React
 * Native views on mobile. Adding a platform means writing one skin, not a second
 * transcript.
