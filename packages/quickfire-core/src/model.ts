 * The platform-neutral quickfire view model (quickfire-overlay-spec §4, §7).

 * These types started life in `apps/shell/overlay/quickfireSurfaceModel.ts` as
 * the props contract between the chrome owner and the overlay surface. The
 * mobile sheets render the same information natively, and the parity rule in
 * `apps/shell/SKILL.md` is explicit that the two clients share canonical

 * Everything in this module is JSON-shaped: on desktop it still crosses a
