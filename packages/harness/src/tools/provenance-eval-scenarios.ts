/**
 * The provenance eval catalog: the balance is measured, not asserted.
 *
 * Each canonical question has a normative budget — tool calls and rendered
 * provenance tokens — that the redesign claims to hit. This module is the
 * machine-readable statement of those claims plus the fixture shape each
 * scenario needs. The scenario *runner* is deliberately not implemented here:
 * this repository has no agentic-eval harness to host it (`packages/eval` is
 * the JavaScript execution sandbox, not an agent eval suite), so wiring these
 * into a runner is a separate, honest piece of work rather than a fake pass.
 *
 * Status values say exactly how far each scenario got:
 *  - `scaffolded`: fixture shape and budget recorded here; no runner yet.
 *  - `covered-by-unit-test`: the mechanism's behavior is asserted by a named
 *    deterministic test, though not its token/call economics.
