/**
 * One walk of the workspace source tree (spec §2.2, P6 consolidation).
 *
 * There used to be two: `collectLaunchablePanelGroups` here for the launcher's
 * "which panels can I open" catalogue, and `collectPanelSourceSuggestions` in
 * `@vibestudio/shared/panelChrome` for the title bar's panel-path completion.
 * Same recursion, same nodes, two answers that could drift. P6 keeps both
 * *answers* — they really are different projections, one needs
 * description/icon/hidden and the other needs packages, skills and units — but
 * derives them from a single `visitWorkspaceNodes`.
 *
 * Everything here is pure. `getSharedPanelAddressOptions` takes the repository
 * reader as an injected adapter rather than importing a runtime client, so this
 * module still loads in a panel, the shell chrome, an overlay document and
 * React Native alike.
