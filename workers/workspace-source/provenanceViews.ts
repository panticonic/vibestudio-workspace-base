/**
 * The relational contract of the semantic record.
 *
 * `prov_*` views — not the canonical tables — are the public surface an agent
 * may query. The tables stay private and freely refactorable; a refactor that
 * preserves view semantics is invisible to every agent surface.
 *
 * Every state-anchored view joins through the caller-scoped visibility basis
 * (`prov_vis_events`, `prov_vis_applications`, `prov_vis_commands`), which the
 * executor refills per query from the reachable context authorities the host
 * supplies. A static SQLite view cannot vary by caller, so the caller varies
 * the basis instead. The Durable Object is single-threaded, so a refilled
 * scratch table is exactly as caller-private as a temp table would be, and
 * unlike `CREATE TEMP TABLE` it needs no unversioned per-connection state.
